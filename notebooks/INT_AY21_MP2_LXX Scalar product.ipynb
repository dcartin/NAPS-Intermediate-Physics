    "As we have seen in physics class, there are several times where mathematical tools are necessary to properly explain and understand physics concepts. For example, so far, you have seen trigonometry and vectors. These have helped us describe the motion of projectiles, see what happens when objects collide, and understand how moving objects appear to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on vectors, up to this point, you have seen how to add and subtract vectors (*vector addition*) and to make them bigger or smaller in size (*scalar multiplication*), possibly flipping their direction 180$^\\circ$ at the same time. Is there anything else we can do with vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that, given two vectors, there are two other mathematical operations we will see in this course. The first is called the **scalar product** (although often I will say \"dot product\", because of the symbol used!), which takes two vectors ${\\vec A}, {\\vec B}$ and outputs a scalar ${\\vec A} \\cdot {\\vec B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** The scalar product gives you a *scalar*, not a vector!\n",

    "As with all math ideas we use in this course, the scalar product is helpful in summing up an important physical idea:\n",

    "> The scalar product ${\\vec A} \\cdot {\\vec B}$ depends on the size $A$ and $B$ of the two vectors, and the angle $\\theta$ between them.\n",

    "You will see at different points that this gives you important information about the physics in a particular situation. In the next lesson after this one, we will use the scalar product to find the motion of a block along a ramp (or *inclined plane*) by separating the forces that are parallel and perpendicular to the incline. Later on, you will see the scalar product when we find the *work* done on an object by a force; this will be the first step in finding the mechanical energy of the object as it moves along.\n",
    "\t\t\n",

    "\n",
    "The easiest way to define what the scalar product does to the two vectors involved is to see what it does to the unit vectors ${\\hat x}, {\\hat y},$ and ${\\hat z}$ that point along each of the three axes. Remember that any vector in three-dimensional space can be written as the *vector* sum of scalar multiples of these vectors. It will be easy to see this, since the scalar product is defined so that it \"strips off\" the components of the vector. For example, if you have an arbitrary vector ${\\vec A}$, then it can be written as the vector sum\n",

    "\n",
    "So what definition is necessary in order for this to happen? Again, the idea is that the scalar product with a unit vector is \"stripping off\" the piece of the other vector in that direction.

    "\n",
    "Now we return to vectors. First, when I think of \"making a vector bigger\", what am I saying? If I have a vector ${\\vec V}$, and make it twice as big, I can imagine this means making the magnitude $V$ twice as big. But this is the idea behind *scalar multiplication*, where we multiply each component of the vector by the same scalar. I could also imagine that I \"make the angle bigger\", but that quickly leads to weird thinking -- if an acceleration vector has a magnitude of 3.00 m/s$^2$ at 40.0$^\\circ$ west of south, and I triple it, is the new vector now at 120$^\\circ$ west of south? What does that mean? (It might help to try and draw a picture, to see that this description of an angle is not useful!)\n",

If I wanted to \"divide\" the vector ${\\vec A}$ by the vector ${\\vec B}$, I could guess that I divide the components of ${\\vec A}$ by those of ${\\vec B}$. But what if one of the components of ${\\vec A}$ is zero? Or of ${\\vec B}$? Do I get a unique answer for this division, or are there multiple possibilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the scalar product defined here is different than ordinary multiplication of numbers. We have seen that there are vectors whose scalar product is zero -- those vectors must be perpendicular to each other. But we can't imagine \"undoing\" the scalar product (as division \"undoes\" multiplication) in a case like that. It is not helpful to think of the scalar product as \"multiplying vectors\", it is something different!"

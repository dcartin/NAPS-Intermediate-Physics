    "Up to this point, we have only talked about situations with a constant acceleration. This gives rise to either motion along a line (such as a book sliding along a table) or at most, the parabolic motion we saw for projectiles. However, this does not exhaust all of the possibilities! We can consider cases where the direction of the acceleration changes, even if the magnitude does not. The prime example of this, and what we will look at in this lesson, is the case of **uniform circular motion**. This is motion that is \"uniform\" -- the *speed* is constant (although the *velocity* will not be!) -- and \"circular\" -- the object in question moves in a circular path around a fixed point.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure that you can think of many examples of uniform circular motion: a car driving around a circular track, a tetherball on its string as it circles the central pole, the Moon orbiting the Earth. In fact, the last case is an interesting historical story, since Newton used the Moon's orbit to figure out that gravitation was a universal force acting on all objects. The distance to the Moon, and the time it takes to make one orbit, had been known since the time of the ancient Greeks. Newton used these numbers to calculate the magnitude of the Moon's acceleration, and showed that it could be the result of a gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon if gravity acted in a particular way. We will explore this more when we get to gravitation in Lesson 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define uniform circular motion.\n",
    "* State the magnitude and direction of the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion.\n",
    "* Explain the relationship between centripetal force and net force on an object.\n",
    "* Solve for the speed of an object in uniform circular motion using Newton's 2nd law."

    "As defined above, *uniform circular motion* is the motion of an object with at constant speed in a circular path around a point. Notice that *velocity* is not constant, since the instantaneous direction of the object's motion at any point is changing; only the magnitude of the velocity is assumed to be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the examples of uniform circular motion listed in the first section above: a car driving around a circular track, a tetherball on its string as it circles the central pole, the Moon orbiting the Earth. Remember that Newton's first law says that an object will continue with constant velocity unless acted on by a net force. Since all of these have changing velocity, their circular motion must be due to a net force (from Newton's second law). What force or forces are causing this motion for each of the cases? It depends!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The force of *friction* keeps the car moving in a circle around the track. The easy way to see this is to think about what would happen on an icy track; which way would the car move then?\n",
    "1. The *gravitational* force is responsible for the Moon's circular orbit. In fact, as we will see in Lesson 25, it is actually that the Earth and the Moon are *both* orbiting around the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system! We don't notice this effect, because the Earth has about 81 times the Moon's mass.\n",
    "1. For the tetherball on its tether, we have to be careful about what is causing the circular motion. It is definitely related to the tether, but not the entire force. If you draw an FBD for the system, the vertical part of the tension force is opposing the force of gravity, so the tetherball does not fall down. Only the *horizontal component of the tension force* is acting to keep the tetherball in a (horizontal) circle.\n",

    "As mentioned above, one of the big mistakes students make is to put the wrong direction for the centripetal acceleration. Hopefully, after working through the code above, you see why the direction is the way it is! There is a second big mistake that students make, dealing with the centripetal force. Let's talk about that now.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen that an object moves in uniform circular motion when there is an acceleration pointing towards the center of the circle with a magnitude of $a_{cp} = v^2 _t / r$. By Newton's second law, this tells us the direction of the net force acting on the object. Here is the key part: **centripetal force** is a *new* name for any net force moving in uniform circular motion. In other words, we are not introducting a new interaction, such as gravity, tension, or friction. Instead, we are collecting any and all forces that contribute to circular motion, and calling it the centripetal force. Note that some of the forces involved may actually \"fight\" this inward-pointing direction. For example, if you are riding a roller coaster at the bottom of a loop, the force of gravity points *away* from the loop's center; only the fact that the normal force is larger, and pointing towards the center of the loop, keeps you moving along the track in circular motion.\n",

    "Let's do an example to see how uniform circular motion arises from the centripetal acceleration. Suppose a 1.20 kg tetherball is swinging in a horizontal circle with a tangential speed at 15.0 mph, as shown in the picture below. The radius of the horizontal circle is 2.31 ft; the rope holding the ball in its path makes an unknown angle $\\theta$ with the vertical. We will find this angle $\\theta$, as well as the magnitude of the tension force the rope exerts on the tetherball.\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many situations where objects move in a circle, from a car driving around a turn, to the planets orbiting the Sun. This is due to an acceleration that has a constant magnitude, but a continually changing direction. We will build on these ideas in future lessons. The obvious case, mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, is the orbits of objects in space, due to the gravitational force (covered in Lesson 25). Another occurrence is looking at the motion of a mass on a spring, if the mass is \"orbiting\" as well, moving in an elliptical path. Both of these examples have a lot of similarities in their motion, and hopefully we will get a chance to discuss this a little.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these ideas can be extended further. We have assumed a fixed speed, for example; there is also the possibility that the speed is changing as well as the direction. This is known as *non-uniform* circular motion. In this case, there is the centripetal acceleration talked about in this lesson, pointing towards the center of the circle, as well as a tangential acceleration pointing either in the same direction, or the opposite direction, to the motion. This might happen if you use the gas or brakes as you drive a car around a turn.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Define centripetal acceleration, and state its direction.\n",
    "* Explain the relationship between inertia and \"centrifugal force\".\n",
    "* Use Newton's 2nd law for an object in uniform circular motion to find an unknown force.\n",
    "* Understand the advantages and disadvantages of different numerical methods."

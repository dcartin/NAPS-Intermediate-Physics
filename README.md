## Marking period 2 notebooks

### [Scalar product](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dcartin/NAPS-Intermediate-Physics/blob/master/lessons/INT_AY21_MP2_LXX%20Scalar%20product.ipynb): The scalar product is a basic mathematical tool that will be used in various applications. We will often use it to find the angle between two vectors, and in particular, to show that two vectors are perpendicular.

### [Inclined planes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dcartin/NAPS-Intermediate-Physics/blob/master/lessons/INT_AY21_MP2_LXX%20Inclined%20planes%20without%20friction.ipynb): The inclined plane was important in the history of physics in understanding motion under constant acceleration. Here, the basic set-up is given, and we develop methods to solve for the motion of an object moving on an inclined plane.

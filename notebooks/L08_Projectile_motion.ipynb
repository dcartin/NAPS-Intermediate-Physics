    "This lesson combines together essentially everything you have seen so far in the course. Much like [Lesson 05 (acceleration and free-fall)](accel), a projectile is an object in a gravitational field, which determines the acceleration of the object. In that lesson, we used a vPython simulation to visualize the projectile's motion; you will do the same thing here, only now in two dimensions. Not only can the projectile go up and down, but now it can go sideways!\n",
    "\n",
    "The object's constant acceleration can be used in conjunction with the kinematic equations from [Lesson 06](kin-eqns) to describe the motion at any time between its start and end. Specifically, this means solving for the position or velocity vectors. To actually calculate for these quantities, we need their vector components; however, in [Lesson 07 (vector magnitude and direction)](vec-mag-dir), you saw how to switch between a description of a vector in terms of components, and one given by magnitude and direction. Also, we can now graph both the position and velocity components in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and see how the constant downward gravitational field results in characteristic shapes for these graphs.\n",

    "## Independence of motion\n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to start studying projectile motion is to create a simulation of it. Go to the Lesson 08 page of the website [dcartin.github.io](https://dcartin.github.io), and click on the `x and y motion components` link at the top of this page to take you to the next program I will discuss. This program creates a vPython animation of a ball moving in projectile motion as it falls to the ground. The **launch angle** is set to be zero -- this is the angle between the initial velocity (i.e. at $t = 0$) and the horizontal (here, the $+x$ axis). In the simulation, for every *tenth* time step, a small ball is created to mark its position, as well as the $x$ and $y$ components of that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before you run the program, look through the code that creates the simulation. Again, the gravitational field is defined to be a downward pointing vector with a magnitude of 9.81 m/s$^2$.\n",

    "```\n",

    "Since gravity is the only force acting on the projectile, this means the *only* acceleration is downward (in the $-y$ direction); there is no acceleration along the horizontal $x$ axis! This is what we mean by **projectile motion** -- the same thing as the free-fall we studied earlier, but now with the freedom for the projectile to move horizontally *and* vertically.\n",

    "When you run the simulation, you should notice the following consequences of the constant downward acceleration. First, the spheres marking the $x$ motion of the ball are evenly spaced. Remember in [Lesson 05](accel), we saw this represents a constant velocity component in that direction. Since $a_x = 0$, then $v_x$ is constant. However, the spheres marking the ball's $y$ motion get further apart as they move downward towards the ground. This reflects the downward velocity component getting larger, as the ball travels a further distance every time interval. With $a_y \\ne 0$, $v_y$ is constantly changing, with this change pointing downward since the acceleration does as well.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These basic properties of projectile motion are called the **independence of motion** in the vertical and horizontal directions. When we neglect air resistance, and only include the effect of gravity, the downward acceleration of the ball does not have any effect on the horizontal motion. Said differently, the motion of the projectile is the combination of (1) an object falling straight downward, plus (2) an object moving horizontally at a constant speed. These two motions are marked in the simulation by the spheres for the separate $x$ and $y$ motions. This fact actually remains true for high-speed objects, such as a bullet. If you go to this point in the Lesson 08 page of the website [dcartin.github.io](https://dcartin.github.io), you will find a link to a video clip from a MythBusters episode demonstrating this."

This will be an important idea -- if we can find the time of flight in one direction, we can use it to get information about the perpendicular direction.\n",

The program `Projectile motion graphs` (available on the Lesson 08 page of the website [dcartin.github.io](https://dcartin.github.io)) will produce two graphs, one for the position components of the ball, and the other for the velocity components.

If the projectile is initially traveling upward, it will reach a maximum height. This point can be seen in the $r_y$ as its largest value (the \"peak\" of the curve). As we will talk more about below, the max height is also the point in the $v_y$ vs. $t$ graph when $v_y = 0$, so the line crosses the time axis. The vector components of the projectile's total displacement is given in the differences in each of the position components $r_x$ and $r_y$ over the entire time of flight.

    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson combines together essentially everything you have seen so far in the course. Much like Lesson 04 (acceleration and free-fall), a projectile is an object in a gravitational field, which determines the acceleration of the object. In that lesson, we used a vPython simulation to visualize the projectile's motion; you will do the same thing here, only now in two dimensions. The object's constant acceleration can be used in conjunction with the kinematic equations from Lesson 05 to describe the motion at any time between its start and end. Specifically, this means solving for the position or velocity vectors. To actually solve for these quantities, we need their vector components; however, in Lesson 06 (vector magnitude and direction), you saw how to switch between a description of a vector in terms of components, and one given by magnitude and direction. Also, we can now graph both the position and velocity components in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and see how the constant downward gravitational field results in characteristic shapes for these graphs. Finally, we will see what happens when air resistance is present, and the projectile's acceleration is not solely determined by the gravitational field near the surface of the Earth.\n",

    "So far, we have only talked about projectile motion -- the case where the acceleration of an object near the surface of the Earth is solely due to the Earth's gravitational field. However, in physics, once you understand the simplest case, it is time to move on to including added effects! What we have done so far is good enough to land a projectile on a specific location, more or less, but accuracy is important in many applications. In artillery, for example, the study of the effects of air resistance on the motion of the projectile over the centuries was a serious endeavour, starting with Niccolo Tartaglia mentioned at the beginning of the lesson. You can find many examples of the \"range tables\" produced for artillery operators; the short [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_table) on the topic has an image from an early 20th century table. As weapons became more advanced, even the rotation of the Earth had to be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drag force, which measures the effect that air or other fluids has on an object, is a complicated creature. There is no one clean formula for this, since fluid dynamics can be very involved. The drag force depends on the type of fluid flow around the object -- is it smooth or turbulent? This depends on factors such as the speed, shape and size of the object. It also depends on the fluid itself. Does the fluid resist motion (i.e. is it viscous)? The viscosity of air is much different than that of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning about these issues would be a course in itself, so I will keep it simple here. We will use the form of drag force that works fairly well for a large, fast-moving object. This gives turbulent fluid flow around the object. Then, the magnitude of the drag force $F_D$ is given by\n",

The direction of the drag force is opposite to the motion; in other words, the direction is given by $-{\\hat v}$, where ${\\hat v}$ is the unit vector pointing in the same direction as the velocity.

This is the maximum *speed* $v_{term}$ of an object when it experiences an acceleration due to both the gravitational field and air resistance. Since this is the largest speed of the object, it cannot be accelerating any faster, so that ${\\vec a} = 0$. Note that there is *no* terminal velocity when air resistance is absent -- the speed of a projectile in vacuum will increase until it hits the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem:** Using the fact that the acceleration is given by ${\\vec a} = {\\vec g} - k v^2 {\\hat v}$, derive the equation for what the terminal velocity $v_{term}$ would be for an object falling vertically. This means we only include the $y$ component $-g$ of the acceleration, and the unit vector ${\\hat v}$ is pointing downward. Be careful -- $v_{term}$ is still the *speed*, not the $y$ component of the velocity!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem:** Using your equation from the last problem, and the current value of the coefficient `K_DRAG` for the code in the cell above, calculate the terminal velocity for the object, set the initial speed to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below is a copy of the one above, but with the correct updating for `ball.accel`, and a place to create a $y$ *velocity* component vs. time graph. Go through the same procedure like you did above to create this graph, and then run the cell. Does your prediction match the terminal velocity? How can you tell? There will be one graph that is particularly helpful in finding the answer to these questions. Try changing the value of `K_DRAG` and see if the behavior of the ball changes."

You must use the kinematic equations to solve for the position and velocity vectors, based on the given acceleration. Hopefully you have also seen how graphs can be informative, especially when trying to find specific points of the trajectory, such as the maximum height. Adding in air resistance tests this knowledge, since many of the expectations you may have from projectile motion no longer hold true!\n",

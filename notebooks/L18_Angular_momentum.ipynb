    "In [Lesson 11](lin-mom-Newton), the idea of linear momentum was introduced. Remember that this quantity is a good one to use when thinking about the inertia of an object. Linear momentum stays the same unless acted on by a net force (Newton's 1st law); the size of the change in linear momentum is related to the size of this net force (Newton's 2nd law). Thus, we could talk about the conservation of linear momentum when a system was isolated, i.e. no *external* forces acted on the system. Collisions were a good example of using this conservation principle to understand the motion of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now go through an \"angular\" or \"rotational\" version of momentum. However, we will see that many of the same ideas hold here as they do with linear momentum -- angular momentum changes due to the action of a net torque (or \"rotational force\"), while angular momentum is conserved in isolated systems. Perhaps surprisingly, this conservation of angular momentum works even if the object moves in a straight line! As long as we have a reference point (the ${\\vec r} = 0$ location), we can calculate the angular momentum of an object around that point, regardless of what kind of motion the object has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angular momentum is very important in dealing with my favorite force: the gravitational force. Specifically, we can use conservation of angular momentum to talk about the orbit of one object around another (e.g. the Moon and the Earth). Indeed, it can be used for any central force, such as the spring force or the electrostatic force. Later on, we will also have discuss the principle of mechanical energy conservation, and between these two conservation principles, we can calculate quite a bit about an orbiting body. We will see a hint of that by the end of this lesson.\n",

Newton's second law then relates the net external force to the change in the system's linear momentum.\n",

    "In a similar manner, angular momentum ${\\vec L}$ is a measure of the rotational motion of an object about a chosen axis. Much like Newton's 2nd law says changes in linear momentum are due to net forces, there is a corresponding rotational version of this equation.

    "The attentive reader may notice that I have tried to pull a fast one on you! Before, I said that conservation of linear momentum in the absence of net external forces is a re-statement of the principle of inertia (Newton's 1st law). However, inertia only deals with constant *velocity*. As we saw when we discussed uniform circular motion, there is no corresponding \"rotational\" version of Newton's 1st law -- in other words, objects do not have a natural tendency to rotate, since this requires a centripetal force acting on the object. However, it turns out that the answer to this riddle deals with the *symmetry* of physics. One (slightly strange) way to say this is that if I took the entire Universe and rotated it, the laws of physics would be exactly the same -- no one would notice! Modern physics is now based heavily on this idea of symmetry, based on the ideas of [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether), as discussed in the following videos linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf0zCaqrwM), and more in-depth [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ERSb06dOg).\n",

One component $r_{||}$ is in the same direction as the velocity ${\\vec v}$, so it points parallel to the dotted line. The other component $r_\\perp$ is perpendicular to this line. If you look back at the left-hand diagram, you will see that there is a second dotted line, passing through the point $P$, parallel to the motion of the mass. The two angles $\\theta$ are thus the same, since they are related by two parallel lines (the dotted lines) crossed by the same transversal (the position vector).

    "We will now delve further into the notion of angular momentum using vPython. The program `Angular momentum and linear motion` (found on the Lesson 18 page on the site [dcartin.github.io](https://dcartin.github.io)) creates a ball moving with a constant velocity. Thus, the ball will move along the line $r_y = +2$ at constant speed $v = 1$. The ball is also given a mass `M`, defined at the beginning of the program. In addition, there are two arrows in the simulation: a yellow arrow showing the constant velocity ${\\vec v}$ of the ball, and a cyan arrow showing the changing ball position ${\\vec r}$. Make sure you have the program in front of you, so you can both run and modify it, as described below. Run the program, and note how ${\\vec r}$ and ${\\vec v}$ change with time."

The key point is to realize that, just like at the maximum radius, when the ball is at its minimum radius, it has stopped moving towards the center. Thus, the radial component of the velocity $v_r = 0$; you can see these are the points where the red line passes through a value of zero.

    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we see another rotational quantity that has its analogue in linear motion. Just as torque is similar (but not the same as!) force, the angular momentum of an object is similar to its linear momentum. Each pair of physical quantities are related, but the addition of the position vector ${\\vec r}$ and the vector product are an extra element that you need to consider. The analogy goes on to relate net torque and angular momentum with the rotational version of Newton's second law (just as we saw in [Lesson 11](lin-mom-Newton) between net force and linear momentum).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw that the angular momentum of a system remains the same when the net torque on that system is zero. Such conservation laws are an important tool in physics, and the conservation of angular momentum is no exception. In fact, when combined with the conservation of mechanical energy, these two principles will go far in describing the motion of an orbiting body when considering Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define angular momentum, either for a generic object or for a point mass.\n",
    "* Calculate the angular momentum of an object around a given point ${\\vec r} = {\\vec 0}$.\n",
    "* Explain when angular momentum is conserved.\n",
    "* Use conservation of angular momentum to calculate the mass or speed of an object."

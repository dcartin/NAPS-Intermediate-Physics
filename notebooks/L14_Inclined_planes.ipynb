    "Everyone has heard of the famous experiment where Galileo Galilei dropped two masses off the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in order to show that the force of gravity accelerated all objects equally. Unfortunately, this story is probably not true! What he did instead is more interesting, and leads to actual mathematical relationships dealing with acceleration and gravity. His experiment is a prime example of how the inclined planes we will discuss in this lesson were important to our greater understanding of physics. As described in the video linked below, he rolled a ball down a groove at an angle to the horizontal, and saw how the ball would accelerate."

    "We will study this example, and others like it. In this lesson, there will be the conjunction of several topics we have talked about before: the scalar product, Newton's laws of motion, and the force of gravity. As detailed before, the scalar product allows us to divide a vector into pieces along a set of directions. However, instead of the usual \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" directions (or $x, y$, and $z$ axes), we will use the directions \"parallel\" and \"perpendicular\" to the ramp or incline. This, along with Newton's 2nd law, allows us to find the equation of motion for an object moving along the ramp. For now, this motion will be from gravity, along with possible applied forces. Later, in Lesson 15, we will learn about friction, so that we can consider ramps with friction in Lesson 16.\n",

    "# Normal force\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the mathematics of an inclined plane, we first need to talk about a new force, known as the **normal force**. The best way to think about the normal force is that it is the force that prevents one object from passing through another. When you sit on a chair, or lean against a wall, these objects exert a normal force on you, so you do not fall through the chair or wall. The normal force is known as a *constraint force*, since it constrains objects from occupying the same location!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the normal force can change, depending on the situation. If you think of yourself leaning against the wall, with your feet still on the floor, both the wall and floor exert normal forces on you. If you change your angle relative to the horizontal (your \"lean\"), then the sizes of the two normal forces will shift. When you are almost vertical, the floor acts on you with the larger normal force; if you move your feet away from the wall, the angle with the horizontal will decrease, and the wall exerts a normal force with increasing size. The important point is that these forces constrain you, so that you don't accelerate through the wall or floor!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these forces prevent you from passing through the floor or wall, so they must be perpendicular to these surfaces -- you don't start sliding sideways, just because you are standing on the floor! Similarly with the wall, where you may slide down the wall, but that is due to gravity, not the force of the wall on you. These forces also point away from the surface (floor or wall).\n",

    "You should see the block move in parabolic path -- it is still accelerating down the ramp, but the motion side-to-side is at a constant rate. This is much like projectile motion, with a smaller value of the acceleration (because of the ramp's angle).\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this in more detail, in the \"Create velocity graph\" part of the main procedure, add a new line to create `velSideCurve`. Use this to graph the component $v_{side} = {\\vec v} \\cdot {\\hat e}_{side}$ in a different color than you chose for `velParCurve`. Update `velSideCurve` in a manner similar to what you did for `velParCurve`, but make sure you change the dot product inside the code. If you did everything correctly, you should see the following graph.\n",

    "This lesson introduced the ideas involved for objects moving on a ramp or inclined plane. As you saw in the Objectives section, this problem has a long history in physics! It is also a nice way to show the interrelationship between the gravitational and normal forces -- the size of the normal force, compared to the object's weight, can be easily changed by altering the ramp angle. The normal force will have a different magnitude for any given angle choice, showing how this force can vary, depending on what is necessary to keep the object from going through the ramp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ramps discussed here are smooth, so there is no force of friction acting on the block as it slides along the incline. After discussing the frictional force in the next lesson, we will then return to inclined planes in Lesson 16, and see how friction can change things.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the normal force acting on an object.\n",
    "* Write down the Newton's 2nd law equations for an object moving on a smooth inclined plane."

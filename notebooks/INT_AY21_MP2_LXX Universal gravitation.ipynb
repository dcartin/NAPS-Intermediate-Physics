Before we do this, however, it is probably helpful to remind ourselves of the mathematical notation we used in Lesson RELATIVE MOTION.

But what if we are measuring the position vector of our object away from another point that is *not* the origin? Suppose we have a point $A$, which has a position vector ${\\vec r}_A = a_x {\\hat x} + a_y {\\hat y} + a_z {\\hat z}$ as seen by the origin. There is also a second point $B$ at position ${\\vec r}_B = b_x {\\hat x} + b_y {\\hat y} + b_z {\\hat z}$. How is object $B$ seen by someone observing at point $A$?

This means that if I find the force of gravity *on* myself *due to* the Earth, I am actually exerting the same size force *on* the Earth! This means that each of the masses appears equally in the equation: if I calculate the magnitude of the gravitational force on $m_1$ due to $m_2$, I should get the same magnitude if I do it on $m_2$ due to $m_1$. Continuing with Newton's third law, the force on $m_1$ due to $m_2$ should have the opposite direction as the force on $m_2$ due to $m_1$. In other words, the last two facts tell us we expect\n",

Finally, much like the forces of air resistance, friction, and springs, we expect there will be a constant that tells us how strong the force of gravity is. However, this is a *universal* law, so it applies the same to every pair of objects! Thus, the constant will be the same throughout the Universe.\n",

    "So far, we have looked at the universal force of gravity between two masses. In conjunction with Newton's third law, we can focus on one of the two masses, and find how the gravitational interaction affects it specifically. But what happens when we want to look at more than two masses? We will see this is much like finding the net force on a block sliding along a carpeted floor. In that case, we separately find each of the individual forces -- gravity, normal force, friction, perhaps an applied force -- and then calculate the vector sum of these to get ${\\vec F}_{net}$. In order to find the net *gravitational* force on one mass due to a collection of others, we do the same thing. For a given mass $M$:\n",

You are asked to find the net gravitational force on $m_1$ due to the other three. We first draw the FBD for the gravitational forces acting on the mass $m_1$, as shown on the right-hand side.\n",

If we change our altitude significantly (say by leaving the atmosphere), then the weight of an object start to be noticeable different than its weight at sea level. However, it turns out that the idea of a gravitational field ${\\vec g}$ is still a useful one. Let's explore further by first thinking about some properties of the gravitational force.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the answer to the last problem does not depend *at all* on the properties of the mass $M_0$, *only* the sizes of the two other masses. Specifically, it depends on the ratio of 4 to 1 between mass $4M$ of the larger object to mass $M$ of the smaller. The mass $M_0$ can be big or small, but its size doesn't come into play at all. Thus, we have \"factored out\" by $M_0$ to find the location where the net gravitational force on it is zero.\n",

    "![Two falling masses, with their gravitational forces and fields shown](../img/INT_AY20_MP2_L27_Fig07b-Falling_masses_w_accel_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar idea happens when we compare gravitational force and acceleration. The force of gravity ${\\vec F}_g$ on an object is directly proportional to the mass of the object. Suppose two masses are dropped, with a large mass $M$ and a small mass $m$. Then the force of gravity will be larger on the larger mass $M$. For the same masses, however, the acceleration will be the same (neglecting air resistance). Remember in Lesson FREE-FALL that we defined ${\\vec g}$ to be the acceleration of an object when gravity is the only force acting on it. In particular, the acceleration ${\\vec a}$ is same for all falling objects near the Earth's surface, which is why we said it was a constant. However, when we look more generally -- using the universal law of gravitation -- then the acceleration of an object may change, but that acceleration does not depend on the size of the mass itself! Thus, when the net force acting on a mass is a gravitational force due to the interactions with all the surrounding masses, the acceleration ${\\vec a} = {\\vec g}$ is a measure of the influence of those surrounding masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of gravitational field\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we will define the **gravitational field** much as we did previously in Lesson FREE-FALL; however, we will now emphasize the importance of the other masses involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The gravitational field ${\\vec g}$ at a particular location is the acceleration of any object placed at that location when the net force acting on the object is *solely* due to gravitational forces from the interactions with other masses. (**Units:** N/kg or m/s$^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can take Newton's second law, and rewrite it as a definition of ${\\vec g}$. For any mass $m_0$ placed at a given position, the gravitational field at that position is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\t{\\vec g} = \\frac{{\\vec F}_g}{m_0}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it does not depend on the mass $m_0$ at the location; we are using $m_0$ to *test* what the gravitational field is there. Thus, you will often see the mass $m_0$ referred to as a **test mass**. You can also see why the field does not depend on $m_0$ -- this gets back to the \"factoring out\" we were talking about above. If you increase $m_0$ by a factor (say, double it), you will increase the gravitational force ${\\vec F}_g$ on it by exactly the same factor -- the two increases will cancel out, and you will get the *exact same field*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** Every point in space has a gravitational field at it; there does *not* actually have to be anything there to measure it! The idea of a test mass is that *if* I were to put one at a given location, I could use it measure its acceleration, and thus the field. I don't have to continually drop my pencil to know that there is a gravitational field everywhere in my office. It suffices to know that if I did pick a spot somewhere, place my pencil there and let go, it would fall downward towards the Earth's center at 9.8 m/s$^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition is an operational definition, i.e. it is centered on the object $m_0$ we use to measure the gravitational field -- simply find its acceleration, and that gives the vector ${\\vec g}$ at that particular position. The field you would measure where you are is due to every single mass on the Universe, and their combined gravitational influence at your location. That's a lot! Often we want to reduce our focus down to how one particular object $M$ is exerting a gravitational force on your test mass $m_0$. For example, what is the gravitational field of just the Earth when you are at sea level? Then, we can start by finding the force between $m_0$ and $M$, namely ${\\vec F}_{g, Mm_0}$. By using a modified version of the definition, this would give us the gravitational field at the position of $m_0$ *solely* due to the mass $M$:\n",

Every object $M$ in the Universe creates its own gravitational field ${\\vec g}_M$, although some (like the Earth's) are much larger at a particular location than others (like yours!). Then the field ${\\vec g}$ defined at the beginning of this section is the vector sum of all the individual gravitational fields from all the objects around $m_0$.\n",

First, we look at the work done by gravity as a function of radius. This is a *non-constant* force, so it helps to graph it. Below is a graph of the gravitational acceleration $g$ due to the Earth versus the height $h$ above the Earth's surface.

    "When we discussed gravitational potential energy near the surface of the Earth, we talked about the need to set a \"reference height\" as the zero value for potential energy. However, for spring (or elastic) potential energy, the zero distance was set by the spring force itself -- $U_{spr} = 0$ when $r = 0$ at the equilibrium length of the spring. So, for the general form of gravitational PE, which should we choose? There is a natural choice for *any* mass -- the radius $r = \\infty$ (\"very far away\") Thus, gravitational potential energy is set so $U_{grav} (\\infty) = 0$.\n",

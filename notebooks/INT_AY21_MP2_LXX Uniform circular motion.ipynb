Since the new ball position ${\\vec r} (t + \\Delta t)$ is found using the tangential ${\\vec v} (t)$, then the new `ball.pos` will tend to overshoot the circle. Thus, the error in the new position will tend to be outside the original circle, leading to the spiralling outward.\n",

    "However, it is not very smart about reducing numerical error, as our circular motion examples above show. Part of the problem is that motion is not in discrete time steps, but is continuous. So breaking up time into steps $\\Delta t$ will automatically lead to errors. If the quantities calculated at each multiple of $\\Delta t$ are off by even a little bit, this small error compounded over many time steps will eventually become appreciable. This is why, when you start learning about calculus, you see that the basic kinematic equations above should actually be written\n",

    "For us, the practical effect is that making `dt` smaller can improve accuracy. In the cell above, change the definition of `dt` to `0.005`, and compare the new motion and graph.

Next we will explore a technique that also has more calculations, but does them in a more sophisticated way.\n",

When the acceleration depends only on position, for example, there are methods where the velocity is not even calculated. This reduces the number of computations necessary.

Note that the error will not go away completely, since no numerical method can reproduce the continuous flow of time we experience every day.\n",

This two-stage process helps to reduce the amount of error present in the calculations.\n",

So modify the usual updating code appropriately and use it to compute `ball.midpos` and `ball.midvelocity`.\n",
    "1. Next, calculate `midUnitRadial` and `ball.midacceleration`. These use the same form of code as previously, but are using the mid-time step attributes `ball.midpos` and `ball.midvelocity`.\n",
    "1. Finally, you need to update the final position `ball.pos` and velocity `ball.velocity`. Remember that these use a combination of mid-point and initial values, along with the full time step $\\Delta t$. So `ball.pos` needs to be updated using the initial value of `ball.pos` and the mid-point variable `ball.midvelocity`, while `ball.velocity` needs to be updated with the initial `ball.velocity` and the mid-point `ball.midacceleration`.\n",

Remember that this product encodes the magnitude of each of the two original vectors, as well as the cosine of the angle $\\theta$ between them. The scalar product was helpful in Lesson LESSON LINK in finding a new set of unit vectors parallel and perpendicualar to an inclined plane; it also appeared in Lesson LESSON LINK for the definition of the work done by a (constant) force. In this lesson, we are going to define a new mathematical operation, known as the **vector product**. Like the name suggests, this will take two vectors and spit out a third vector.\n",

For now, it is going to be needed to deal with objects that are rotating.

Every rotation consists of two aspects:\n",

Suppose we look at a small change $\\Delta \\theta$ in angle counterclockwise about the $+z$ axis. This rotates vectors in the $x-y$ plane. In other words, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of every point will change because of this rotation, while the $z$ coordinate will remain the same.\n",

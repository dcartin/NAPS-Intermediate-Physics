    "The field of astronomy has the longest history as an observational and mathematical science. Even before written records began, there is evidence that humans were looking upward, as seen in cave paintings and the positioning of physical objects (such as Stonehenge). All the major ancient civilizations -- Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China -- have records of astronomical observations. Depending on the time and place, these were used for timekeeping, such as knowing when to plant crops, as well for divination, with the idea that events in the sky predict those on the Earth. These civilizations, to varying degrees, also started to uses mathematics to predict the motions of stars and planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most developed mathematical models was by Hipparchus of Nicea in the 2nd century BC, based on Babylonian astronomical data and the previous work of Apollonius of Perga about a century before. Hipparchus had to develop what we now know as trigonometry in order to calculate the motion of the Sun and the Moon, as seen from the Earth. His observations were later used by Cladius Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD for his famous astronomical textbook, now known as the *Almagest* from its Arabic translation of the original Greek title.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ptolemaic system and observations were used for centuries, but eventually two problems developed with them. The first is that it was assumed that the stars are fixed on a \"celestial sphere\", and do not move relative to each other. This is not actually true, and over two thousand years, these slight changes become noticeable. The second is that astronomical observations became more accurate, with the development of better instruments. In particular, inspired by earlier observatories in Baghdad and Istanbul, the Danish nobleman Tycho Brahe built in 1576 a large observatory on the island of Hven (now part of Sweden). His measurements of planetary and stellar positions were the best up to that time, and they showed problems with the mathematical models of the time.\n",

    "\n",
    "At that time, there were two competing models for the motion of planets in the Solar System. The **geocentric model**, espoused by Claudius Ptolemy and others, placed the Earth at the center, with Sun, Moon, and planets moving in orbits around it. There was also the **heliocentric model**, which moved the Sun to the center, with the Earth in an orbit around it, just like the other planets. The latest version of this had been proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus, using measurements by Greek and Arab astronomers; this is published just before his death in 1543. However, both of these models based their systems on circular orbits. This had been refined, by imagining circles placed on circles, to get more complicated motions. However, even these modifications still predicted slightly different planetary motions than what was observed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, at the turn of the 17th century, there was a conflict between astronomical observations and the mathematical models trying to predict them. This is where Johannes Kepler stepped in, using Brahe's data in an attempt to clarify the situation. His goal was to use some version of the Copernican system for a heliocentric model, and chose the planet Mars to study specifically. In one way, this was a bad choice -- for many years, he made no progress in getting the motion of Mars to match a Copernican model. However, in the end, Mars was the best choice, since it eventually led him to lay down his three laws of planetary motion. These laws, and some of their consequences, are the topic of this lesson.\n",

    "You might have an image of the Earth and all the other planets moving in circular orbits, with the Sun sitting at the center. This is actually a fairly good picture -- the Earth's orbit around the Sun, for example, is very close to that of a circle. However, if you start taking accurate measurements, you will eventually see that the orbits of the planets are not exactly circular. This was the first key fact that Kepler discovered, and is encoded in his first law of planetary motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Planets move along elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this mean exactly? First, the orbits are ellipses, rather than circles. You can think of an ellipse as a circle that has been \"squashed\" in one direction, so it is bigger in one direction than it is in the perpendicular direction. Although there is still a central point after this squashing, it turns out there are two special points called **focal points** or **foci** (the plural of **focus**). The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to both focal points is always a constant, which you can see in the following video. It also shows the meaning of the term \"major axis\" for the ellipse. The **major axis** of an ellipse is the longest diameter of the ellipse, and passes through both the focal points. The constant sum of distances is just the major axis."

Suppose we divide the period of the planet's orbit -- which would be one year for the Earth -- into twelve \"months\", and draw a line between the planet and the Sun at the beginning of each month. Then Kepler's 2nd law says that the area of each of these wedges is exactly the same. So what does this mean? Since the planet is closest to the Sun on the right-hand side, the wedge is not so long in the left-right direction. On the left side, when the planet is furthest away from the Sun, it has the longest wedge. For these two areas to be the same in the same amount of time, on the right-hand side, the planet has to be traveling the fastest, while on the left-hand side, it must be traveling at its slowest.\n",

    "# Solving force problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We have started with the basic definitions of momentum, and used it in Newton's laws of motion to consider the collision of objects. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of some of the important aspects of forces -- forces are due to an interaction between two objects, and over a time interval will change the velocity of each of the objects. This model of collisions was the basis of the kinetic theory of gases, leading to our current understanding of thermodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many more forces that we have not considered. I am sure that, after a moment's thought, you can make a long list of forces acting on objects. A few forces we will discuss over the coming weeks are friction, buoyancy, and gravity. Because these forces can have different properties, it is important to develop a standard way of combining these forces together to find the motion of the object they act on. This recipe is what is covered in this lesson. In particular, we will look at free body diagrams (FBDs) as a visual way of finding the correct Newton's 2nd law equation of a particular system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to an important point. There is a standard *method* for solving force problems, but there is not a standard *equation*. Every time you have forces involved in a situation, you should start with an FBD and Newton's 2nd law. But the equation you derive from Newton's 2nd law will be different in each case! This is because the forces may be different, or the directions they act in may change. You will have to think through what is affecting the system, but always using the force equations to do so. This lesson will help to build that intuition within you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe how to draw the free body diagram for an object with one or more forces acting on it.\n",
    "* Calculate the acceleration or final velocity of an object after it experiences a force over a given time interval.\n",
    "* Given the gravitational field at an object's location, state the gravitational force on that object.\n",
    "* State the direction of the tension force acting on an object."

    "## Free body diagrams and Newton's 2nd law\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the convenient facts about the Universe is that you can solve for the overall motion of a complicated system by considering only a few pieces of information. We have seen this before in previous lessons -- for example, how a system of multiple objects can be thought of as a single point, moving along with the center of mass velocity of the system. We will build on this when considering forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can simplify things quite a bit, it makes sense to represent the situation for a system by drawing only those pieces of information that are required. This leads to the idea of a **free body diagram**. A free body diagram (FBD) is a picture of the forces acting on a system. It is a way of succinctly summarizing the forces acting on a system, a single object, or at a single point. We will use these as a thinking aid when solving the equations of Newton's 2nd law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are eliminating any non-essential information in a free body diagram, only the force vectors, and the angles needed to find their components, will be included. This allows for the possibility that a lot of forces are acting on the system at once. Here are some guidelines for drawing an FBD:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Draw the object as a dot; draw x and y axes with the object at the origin\n",
    "* Draw all forces (*not* their components!)\n",
    "    - Forces always point *away* from the object\n",
    "    - Be careful of direction of forces\n",
    "* Do not include other vectors\n",
    "    - No acceleration\n",
    "\t- No velocity\n",
    "    - No net force\n",
    "* In Lesson 21 (work and energy), we will add the displacement vector to FBDs, to help solve for work\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a physical situation, and its corresponding FBD.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A monkey hanging off of a vine, and the free body diagram at the location of its hand](../img/INT_AY20_MP1_L21_Fig01-Monkey_and_FBD_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical situation features a monkey hanging off of a vine. Obviously, the force of gravity is acting downward on the monkey, so that means there is a like downward force on the vine at point $B$. This bends the vine, so at the monkey's hand, two tension forces are acting, one each to the left and right. Thus, the hand is where multiple forces are acting at once. The monkey will remain stationary only if these three forces add up to zero as *vectors*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is represented in the free body diagram to the right of the illustration. Because we are interested in maintaining equilibrium, the FBD is drawn at the point where the monkey's hand is grabbing the vine. The three forces acting at that point are then represented as vectors, pointing away from the dot indicating the position of the hand. This FBD shows all the information needed to write down the Newton's 2nd law equations for that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will formally introduce the two forces from the free body diagram above -- the tension force, and the force of gravity."

    "## The tension force\n",
    "\n",
    "If something like a rope or string (or a vine!) is attached to an object, and then pulled on, that object will experience a **tension** force. This force will act at the point of contact between the rope and the object, and point in the direction along the rope at this contact point. So really, this is a type of applied force, and its magnitude can change, depending on how hard the rope is pulled on. You can imagine a tug-of-war, where the winner is determined by who can pull hardest; this can change, depending on who is working the rope.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that there is no set value or equation for the tension force. Assuming the rope is strong enough, it can be any magnitude. This will usually be a given number, but sometimes it may be something you are solving for.\n",

    "## The gravitational force\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about how to calculate the gravitational force ${\\vec F}_g$, it is important to talk first about terminology. On Earth, we frequently use the terms \"mass\" and \"weight\" interchangeable, and this is not too far off. Since the gravitational field is roughly constant everywhere on the surface of the Earth, then the mass and weight of an object will always be proportional.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is an important conceptual distinction that this glosses over. When we say **mass**, we are referring to the amount of \"stuff\" an object has. This is a fixed property, as long as the object is not split into pieces. Another way to say this is that mass is the measure of inertia -- as we saw with Newton's 2nd law, for the *same* net force, an object with larger mass will have a *smaller* resulting acceleration. More massive objects are harder to move.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different that the weight of an object. **Weight** is the gravitational force on an object. So, unlike mass (which is a scalar), weight is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction. On the Earth's surface, the weight is always acting towards the center of the Earth, which is why we usually don't mention it when state our weight. As we will see shortly, it depends on the object's mass, but it also depends on the gravitational field. Since weight is a force, we will use the symbol ${\\vec F}_g$ for it. I will use \"weight\" and \"gravitational force\" as synonyms, so remember that weight is a vector, not a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in Lesson 04 (acceleration and free fall), the gravitational field ${\\vec g}$ was described as the strength of the gravitational influence of an object on everything around it. Now that we are talking about forces, we can be more explicit in what this means. Once you know what ${\\vec g}$ is at the location of an object with mass $m$, then the gravitational force ${\\vec F}_g$ on that object is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec F}_g = m {\\vec g}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this now explains something else said in Lesson 04: if gravity is the only force acting on the object, then its acceleration is the same as the gravitational field. You can see this by using Newton's 2nd law. Since there is only one force acting on the mass $m$, then the sum of the force is just ${\\vec F}_g$:\n",

    "\n",
    "However, in general, there are multiple forces acting on an object, so ${\\vec g}$ will *not* be the object's acceleration. This is why we describe it as a measure of gravitational influence. In Lesson 23 (gravitational force), we will see how to calculate ${\\vec g}$ in general. This will include not only how to find ${\\vec g}$ near the surface of the Earth, but also when there are multiple sizable objects present.\n",

    "Our first step will be to draw the FBD for the ball. Why are we choosing the ball as the system to consider? Well, this is the object on which all the forces of interest are acting on. By Newton's zeroth law (see Lesson 8), the forces acting directly on the ball are the two tension forces and the ball's weight. We know enough to calculate the weight, and we want to find the tensions, so this is everything we want! Now, let's draw the FBD for the ball. Remember to draw the arrows away from the dot representing the ball, in the same direction as the actual forces. This gives the FBD below for the ball.\n",

This makes physical sense, because whichever rope has the larger angle will be supporting more of the streetlight's weight.\n",

    "We are now beginning to use force methods to solve problems. This lesson introduced this technique, and started with the tension and gravitational forces as examples to see how it works. Over the course of the next few lessons, we will add on additional forces, thus allowing us to look at more complicated situations. The basic ideas from this lesson will hold: the basic technique is to start with an FBD, and derive the appropriate force equations using Newton's 2nd law. This should be your standard practice!\n",

    "* Draw the FBD of a system for any given physical situation.\n",
    "* Using the FBD, write down the appropriate Newton's 2nd law equations.\n",

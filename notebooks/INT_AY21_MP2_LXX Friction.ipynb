    "Leonardo da Vinci was one of the first people to systematically examine the size of the frictional force. In a series of experiments, he showed that friction does not depend on the contact area between the two surfaces, and that increasing the load on an object will increase the frictional force proportionally. However, although his discoveries were written into his notebooks, these were not publicly known until hundreds of years later.\n",

    "Up to this point, we have only looked at collisions in the center of mass frame. In other words, the system must have a total momentum of zero in order to use the coefficient of restitution and find the final velocities of the objects. This is rather limiting, so we need a way of looking at systems with a non-zero total momentum. This falls into the category of \"relative motion\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably have a good sense of what relative motion is already. For example, if you are driving down the road in a car, everything going on inside the car will usually appear to be at rest. This is because everything in the car has the same velocity that you do, so your \"relative\" velocities are zero. On the other hand, you will see the cars going in the opposite direction at a really high speed. It is not that they are actually moving this fast (at least according to a bystander on the ground!), but the cars' velocities combine together to produce the high velocity you see. Relative motion deals with how moving objects appear to each other. Vectors will be important here, since the direction of the objects' velocities can change the resulting relative motion. In fact, such ideas are used in ship navigation, where a maneuvering board (or \"moboard\") provides a convenient way of doing relative motion vector calculations. Although they are slower than electronic means, it is always [a good idea](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/april/moboards-will-never-be-obsolete) to know what your equipment is doing, so you can evaluate it properly.\n",

It is important to make sure you understand that all of your intuition about relative motion are in these equations, as long as you remember to use *vectors* and not magnitudes.

    "> 1. You must conserve momentum for every collision. Remember that the equations for the velocities after the collsion used above feature the center of mass velocity of the colliding objects. So you will need to define a center of mass velocity for every pair of objects. These two velocities can change, so they need to be updated appropriately. It is only the *overall* center of mass velocity that remains the same (i.e. for all three objects)"

    "Relative motion is the description of how moving objects view each other. It plays a key role in the sea services, whether you are on a submarine, ship, or aircraft. We have seen here the defining vector equations used to study relative motion, and shown how these work in both one- and two-dimensional motion. This includes programming such motion into vPython, and viewing a scene from the standpoint of various moving objects. Relative motion also allows us to generalize the notion of collisions in the center of mass reference frame to any general situation, with an arbitrary value of the system's momentum. We are heading next to using this in two-dimensional collisions.\n",

    "* Find the velocity of one moving object as seen by another moving observer.\n",

    "## What is energy?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good time to take stock of what we have covered so far, and what is coming up next. At this point, we have discussed **forces** and **momentum**. The idea of a force is inituitively obvious -- you probably have a sense of it as a \"push\" or a \"pull\". You might have noticed that we never gave a rigorous definition of what a force is, just a list of common forces, and this seems to be a satisfactory way of proceding. Newton's second law then built a bridge between forces and momentum, with net forces acting on an object changing the momentum of that object. We wrote down a mathematical definition of momentum, but the tie-in with Newton's laws gives us an notion of momentum as a measure of the object's *inertia*, its tendency to remain at a constant velocity unless acted on by outside forces. Using forces allows us to find the acceleration of an object, and the kinematic equations then give the complete motion of the object over a given time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike forces and momentum, the idea of energy is not as intuitive. I can feel the force of the wall as I lean against it; I do not \"see\" the force of gravity, but I *can* see its effect on anything I let go of; friction and air resistance are so familiar that we automatically expect objects to slow down to a stop, and we may quietly think that inertia doesn't quite make sense! However, I can't see how the energy of a dropped object changes as it falls, or that of a car braking to a stop. So what is energy?\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture I have in my head when I think of energy is that of accounting and money. If there is something I want, there are three ways that I can get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I can barter with you, i.e. trade you another physical object that you want.\n",
    "* I can give you something, like gold or silver coins, which everyone has decided is a \"store of value\". In other words, we usually do not need the coins themselves, but they are a *representation* of a certain utility to the person who currently has them.\n",
    "* I can use my credit card to buy the item. When I use the card, my bank will decrease the size of a particular number on its computer, and your bank will increase the size of another number on its computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To me, energy is this last sense of money -- in physics, we can attach certain numbers to objects, and these numbers change based on the motion of the object. By themselves, these numbers may be abstract, but as we will see, physicists have chosen the numbers well. Increasing or decreasing these numbers will represent physical processes, much like changing the number for my credit card buys my weekly groceries! So yes, energy is not something I can \"put a finger on\", but it is tied to motions that I can observe. We will see that energy methods are very powerful, and are useful in a variety of situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of work\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a start into energy methods, it is usually to start with the notion of **work**. Unfortunately, this is a word that we use in everyday language to mean many things, but in physics, it has a very particular definition, given below, so it is very important to make sure you use the term properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Work transfers energy either into ($W > 0$) or out of ($W < 0$) a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, this may seem a bit circular, since we have not defined \"energy\" yet, but as we will see next, the mathematical definition of work includes forces acting over a distance. For now, think of it using our credit card analogy from above -- work is like using the card to buy something, and changes numbers in our \"energy\" bank accounts that we will define later. When the only change in the system is its speed, net work results in a change in kinetic energy, depending on the *relative* direction between the net force and the displacement.\n",

Remember that when we last discussed collisions, we used a number $\\epsilon$ called the *coefficient of restitution*, which gave a measure of how \"elastic\" a collision was. In particular, $\\epsilon = 1$ represented an elastic collision, $\\epsilon = 0$ gave a perfectly inelastic collision, and all values in between -- $0 < \\epsilon < 1$ -- were inelastic collisions. The advantage of using the coefficient of restitution is that (1) only one number is needed to signify the type of collision, and (2) this coefficient $\\epsilon$ would give the outcome of *any* collision between the same two objects, regardless of their initial velocities.\n",

To find the coefficient of restitution, we must use the ideas of relative motion and find the velocities of the colliding objects in the *center of mass* (CM) frame; we will denote this frame of reference by \"C\". As a review, the center of mass velocity ${\\vec v}_{C}$ of the system can be found in terms of the velocities ${\\vec v}_{RL}$ and ${\\vec v}_{GL}$ of the objects as seen by us (in the \"lab\" frame $L$), as well as their masses $m_G$ and $m_R$ using\n",

    "1. Use the relative motion equation ${\\vec v}_{AB} = {\\vec v}_{AC} + {\\vec v}_{CB}$ to go from the initial velocities as we see them to the CM frame.\n",

    "> **Problem:** A 5.70 kg block starts on a ramp above a frictionless surface. At the opposite end of the flat surface is a spring, with a spring constant of 670 N/m. The figure is drawn to scale, with each grid square having sides of 25 cm. After letting go of the block on the ramp, it moves across the surface to hit the spring. There is a rough patch along the way of distance $d$, with a coefficient of kinetic friction $\\mu_k = 0.375$. Calculate the position (in cm) where the spring momentarily stops the block.\n",

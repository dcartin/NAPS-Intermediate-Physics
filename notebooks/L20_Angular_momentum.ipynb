    "# Angular momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 08, the idea of linear momentum was introduced. Remember that this quantity is a good one to use when thinking about the inertia of an object. Linear momentum stays the same unless acted on by a net force (Newton's 1st law); the size of the change in linear momentum is related to the size of this net force (Newton's 2nd law). Thus, we could talk about the conservation of linear momentum when a system was isolated, i.e. no *external* forces acted on the system. Collisions were a good example of using this conservation principle to understand the motion of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now go through an \"angular\" or \"rotational\" version of momentum. However, we will see that many of the same ideas hold here as they do with linear momentum -- angular momentum changes due to the action of a net torque, while angular momentum is conserved in isolated systems. Perhaps surprisingly, this conservation of angular momentum works even if the object moves in a straight line! Much like defining torque, as long as we have a reference point (the ${\\vec r} = 0$ location), we can calculate the angular momentum of an object around that point, regardless of what kind of motion the object has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angular momentum is very important in dealing with my favorite force: the gravitational force. Specifically, we can use conservation of angular momentum to talk about the orbit of one object around another (e.g. the Moon and the Earth). Later on, we will also have discuss the principle of mechanical energy conservation, and between these two conservation principles, we can calculate quite a bit about an orbiting body. We will see a hint of that by the end of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in physics classes, you will see how for an extended object (such as a disk, a tire, or a figure skater!), you can use conservation of angular momentum to find the rotational speed of the object. However, we will save things like that for later in the course, when we talk about rotational dynamics in Lesson 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define angular momentum.\n",
    "* State the relationship between torque and angular momentum.\n",
    "* State the condition necessary for angular momentum to be conserved.\n",
    "* Define point mass.\n",
    "* Calculate the unknown mass, position, or velocity of a point mass using conservation of angular momentum.\n",
    "* Define central force."

    "### Definition of angular momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in Lesson 08, linear momentum ${\\vec p}$ was defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\t{\\vec p} = m {\\vec v}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and from the same lesson, it changes whenever there is a net force acting on a system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\t\\sum {\\vec F} = \\frac{\\Delta {\\vec p}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind this is based on Newton's 1st and 2nd laws of motion. The first law says that an object will move with a constant velocity unless acted on by an outside force. In terms of linear momentum, this says that the object (or system of objects) will have a constant ${\\vec p}$ unless external forces are present. Newton's second law then relates the net external force to the change in the system's linear momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar manner, angular momentum ${\\vec L}$ is a measure of the rotational motion of an object about a chosen axis. Much like Newton's 2nd law says changes in linear momentum are due to net forces, there is a corresponding rotational version of this equation. Here, it says that changes in *angular* momentum are due to a net *torque* acting on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\sum {\\vec \\tau} = \\frac{\\Delta {\\vec L}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this can be seen by our analogy between linear and rotational quantities. Here, we replace force with torque, ${\\vec F} \\to {\\vec \\tau}$, and linear momentum with angular momentum, or ${\\vec p} \\to {\\vec L}$. This version of Newton's 2nd law intuitively makes sense as torque changing the \"spinningness\" of an object, as represented by the angular momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The attentive reader may notice that I have tried to pull a fast one on you! Before, I said that conservation of linear momentum in the absence of net external forces is a re-statement of the principle of inertia (Newton's 1st law). However, inertia only deals with constant *velocity*. As we saw when we discussed uniform circular motion, there is no corresponding \"rotational\" version of Newton's 1st law -- in other words, objects do not have a natural tendency to rotate, since this requires a centripetal force acting on the object. However, it turns out that the answer to this riddle deals with the *symmetry* of physics. One (slightly strange) way to say this is that if I took the entire Universe and rotated it, the laws of physics would be exactly the same -- no one would notice! Modern physics is now based heavily on this idea of symmetry, based on the ideas of [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether), as discussed in the following videos."

One component ${\\vec r}_{||}$ is in the same direction as the velocity ${\\vec v}$, so it points parallel to the dotted line. The other component ${\\vec r}_\\perp$ is perpendicular to this line. This component is the special one, so it has its own name -- the **moment arm**.\n",

If you look back at the left-hand diagram, you will see that there is a second dotted line, passing through the point $P$, parallel to the motion of the mass.

For example, if you imagine yourself watching a moving object, you actually only see ${\\vec v}_\\perp$ directly; the motion of the object towards or away from you is only apparent from the changing size of the object. Then, we can just use the angle $\\theta$ between ${\\vec v}$ and ${\\vec r}$ to divide the velocity into components parallel and perpendicular to the *position* vector -- notice we are using \"parallel\" and \"perpendicular\" in a different sense than we did above!

As mentioned above, for extended objects, we can use conservation of angular momentum to find, for example, the rotational speed of an object. However, this depends on defining a quantity known as the *moment of inertia*. Much like mass is a measure of an object's resistance to linear motion, the moment of inertia is the same for rotational motion. However, we will not define it until later, in Lesson 22. This is because, in this lesson, we are focusing on the angular momentum of point masses. This will help us later when we talk about orbiting objects with the gravitational force."

    "When you run the cell above, you should get a pretty pattern for the ball's motion with the constant central force. What is going on here? There are two aspects to the motion -- the ball's motion towards or away from the center (the **radial** motion), and then the motion perpendicular to the radial motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through these one at a time, starting with the radial motion. This is the direction that the force acts, so if that were all there was to this situation, the ball would accelerate towards the center, with an increasing radial velocity $v_r$ component (this is what I called $v_{||}$ above, since it is the velocity component parallel to the ball's position ${\\vec r}$). However, it never gets too close to the center, but instead starts moving outward again. Why is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is related to the perpendicular velocity component $v_\\perp$. As we showed above, the magnitude of the ball's angular momentum $L = rmv_\\perp$. Since $L$ is constant, then as the ball gets closer to the center (smaller $r$), the component $v_\\perp$ of its velocity perpendicular to the position vector ${\\vec r}$ gets *bigger*. Now, when we talked about centripetal acceleration, what we are calling $v_\\perp$ here would have been the tangential velocity component $v_t$. And this is the connection we need! Remember that an object will *maintain* circular motion when the net force on it provides the needed centripetal force. Here, the central force ${\\vec F}_c$ is constant, but the size of $v_t ^2 / r$ is increasing. Thus, eventually the central force is not enough to keep the ball moving in a curved path around the center, and it \"slips\" back outward, to increasing radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a helpful analogy. Suppose you are driving a car, and trying to make a tight turn. If the frictional force is large enough between the tires and the road, you can do this, and the car makes the required path of small radius. However, if your tires slip, or the road is icy, then you can't make the turn, and your car will slip outward to a turn with a larger radius. This is what is happening every time the ball starts moving towards the center, due to the central force."

For the default values given in the cell above, the initial position of the ball is at its largest radius from the center. Let's actually see why that is true. To start, the ball is moving perpendicular to its position vector, so the velocity is all tangential (i.e. it has a zero radial component). Then, we can compare the net force on the ball to the necessary centripetal force needed to keep it at that radius. Plugging in the default numbers from the cell above, we get\n",

If $F_{cp}$ was larger than $F_c$, the ball would have been moving too fast to stay at that radius, and moved outward. Although we haven't talked about it yet in class, you can then use conservation of mechanical energy (Lesson 24) that the ball will *never* go to a larger radius than its initial one.\n",

    "In addition, you can also construct a graph, or have the computer print out the smallest value of the radius, after the ball has traveled for a while (we will be able to calculate the number using conservation of mechanical energy later). If you do this, you get the smallest radius of the ball is 4.03 m. We will now use angular momentum to find the speed of the ball at this radius. The key point is to realize that, just like at the maximum radius, when the ball is at its minimum radius, it has stopped moving towards the center. Thus, the radial component of the velocity $v_r = 0$. In other words, the speed of the ball at this smallest radius is the perpendicular velocity component $v_\\perp$. But this is exactly what appears in the angular momentum! In fact, we can say that, with angular momentum conservation,\n",

This is shown in the figure below, where the ball is at three different locations -- the maximum radius $r_{max}$, the minimum radius $r_{min}$, and an intermediate value $r$ of the radius.

Just as torque is similar (but not the same as!) force, the angular momentum of an object is similar to its linear momentum. Each pair of physical quantities are related, but the addition of the position vector ${\\vec r}$ and the vector product are an extra element that you need to consider. The analogy goes on to relate net torque and angular momentum with the rotational version of Newton's second law (just as we saw in Lesson 08 between net force and linear momentum).\n",

Such conservation laws are an important tool in physics, and the conservation of angular momentum is no exception. In fact, when combined with the conservation of mechanical energy, these two principles will go far in describing the motion of an orbiting body when considering Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n",

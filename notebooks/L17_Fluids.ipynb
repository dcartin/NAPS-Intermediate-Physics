    "Anything that you do in the sea services depends fundamentally on the properties of fluids. If you fly aircraft, you maintain altitude because of the lift on the wings or blades of your craft. The depth your submarine cruises at is a result of how much air versus water the boat has in its ballast tanks. Whether you are a sailor or a marine, your ship stays on the water because a naval architect has ensured the ship is buoyant and maintains its stability in choppy weather. Air and water are two prominent examples of fluids, but there are many others you can probably think of.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that \"buoyant force\" refers to the total force a fluid exerts on an object; however, this force results from the difference in pressure on the top and bottom of the object. The pressure on the bottom is almost always greater, giving an upwards buoyant force. Therefore, this lesson starts with the idea of pressure, and builds on that to develop the buoyant force. It was the great thinker Archimedes who came up with a relatively simple way to find the buoyant force, over two thousand years ago. If you use the resulting Archimedes' principle, you will have an able guide to understand situations with fluids.\n",

    "* Define pressure and density.\n",
    "* State the density of fresh water.\n",
    "* State the value of standard atmospheric pressure in SI units.\n",
    "* Explain Pascal's principle.\n",

We will explore this idea a little as we motivate how the pressure of a fluid can change based on the depth the pressure is measured at.

A barometer is formed when a tube filled with fluid and blocked at both ends is put into a basin of the same fluid, and the bottom end is uncapped. The fluid level in the top of the tube will go down to some level and stay. Why is this?  Based on Aristotle's ideas -- \"nature abhors a vacuum\" -- it was originally believed that a vacuum was formed and could pull the fluid up with a limited amount of force. However, this idea was tested by various people in the 1630s and 1640s. Evangelista Torricelli thought instead it was the weight of the air itself *pushing* the fluid up, until the forces from the air and fluid weights balanced.\n",

    "As mentioned above, for a stationary fluid, the shape of the container does not matter when measuring the pressure at a given depth. Let's explore this notion some more. We can think of the fluid as composed of imaginary bags, each of which is pressing against its neighbors, or the container walls. In equilibrium, these forces will balance out, and the fluid remains stationary. If they did *not* balance out, then the net force on each \"bag of fluid\" would give it an acceleration until the forces *did* balance out, and equilibrium is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose there is an outside force acting on the fluid. This could be something like a piston pressing down on the fluid, or even a change in atmospheric pressure above a lake as a storm front comes into the area. This results in a change in the force on the top of the fluid. The \"bags of fluid\" will then rearrange themselves to account for this different force, until the fluid is again in equilibrium. The upshot is that an external pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted unchanged to every point in the fluid. This is known as **Pascal's principle**. One consequence is that the ressure of a stationary enclosed fluid at one vertical height is the same pressure at a different point with the same vertical height. If it were not, the fluid would flow until the pressures are equalized, and the net force on each \"bag of fluid\" is now zero.\n",

Now let's raise the gauges upward, one of either side of the tube, so that they are always in the same depth of water inside the tube. Because they are in the same fluid at the same depth, they will still read the same pressure. This is true *until* the gauge going up the right side crosses into the oil; because the oil has a different density, the pressures will now be different on either side of the tube.

    "Thus, a floating ship must displace exactly its weight in water in order to stay on the surface. This is why, instead of giving the ship's mass, this statistic is listed as the ship's \"displacement\" (in tons, usually). For submarines, you may see two different displacements -- surface and submerged. The first, like that of the ship, gives the amount of water equivalent to the sub's *mass*; the second gives the amount of water with the same *volume* as the sub. Which would you expect to be bigger?\n",

    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current understanding of how physics works at a fundamental level is that there are four distinct interactions that explain all phenomena. Two of these operate only at the subatomic level, so we don't have direct experience with them. These are the weak nuclear force -- the reason that radioactive nuclei decay -- and the strong nuclear force -- which is why nuclei stay together the rest of the time! However, these forces act over distances of $10^{-15}$ m or less, so we only see their effects only indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there are two fundamental interactions that can act over any distance, because they are represented by inverse square laws. The first of these, gravitation, we looked at in Lesson 25. We now turn to the second, the electrostatic force, as given by Coulomb's law. Much like gravity, the force between stationary electric chargess varies as $1/r^2$. So while it does decrease with larger distance, the force never goes exactly to zero. However, unlike the masses of gravitation, electric charges come in positive and negative varieties. Thus, in most practical applications, the equal number of positive and negative charges in most matter reduces the size of the electrostatic force.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why I keep using \"electrostatic\" as the name of the force, rather than \"electric\". It turns out that when the electric charges are moving, the situation gets more complicated. First, a moving electric charge will create magnetic effects as well; we will talk about magnetism starting in Lesson 34 (magnetic forces and fields). However, the electric effects of the charge do not go away! To treat problems like this properly, one needs to combine both electricity and magnetism into an electromagnetic effect. It was James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist, who first worked out how to do so towards the end of the 19th century. For now, we look at the simpler case of stationary electric charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* State Coulomb's law.\n",
    "* State the direction of the electrostatic force on a charge to due to like or opposite charges.\n",
    "* Given a situation with two or more charges, find the electrostatic force on each of the charges."

    "1. The constant $G$ gives the strength of the gravitational interaction between *any* two masses in the Universe. Making this number bigger or smaller would change the force of gravity between all pairs of objects exactly the same.\n",
    "1. For a *given* object, its mass $m$ describes how it is affected by the gravitational fields of all other objects. Unlike $G$, we can change the mass of a single object, without affecting the masses of any other objects. Changing the mass of an object only changes the magnitude of the gravitational force onit.\n",

    "Using measurements by Greek and Arab astronomers, Nicolaus Copernicus develops a model of the Solar System with the Sun at the center; this is published just before his death in 1543.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tycho Brahe ([source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tycho_Brahe.JPG))](../img/Tycho_Brahe.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by earlier observatories in Baghdad and Istanbul, the Danish nobleman Tycho Brahe built in 1576 a large observatory on the island of Hven (now part of Sweden). He develops his own Solar System model, with all the planets orbiting the Sun, and the Sun orbiting the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Johannes Kepler ([source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Johannes_Kepler_1610.jpg#/media/File:Johannes_Kepler_1610.jpg))](../img/Johannes_Kepler.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Brahe's observations of Mars, Johannes Kepler tries to fit the planet's orbit into the Copernican framework. When he realizes that the orbit is actually an ellipse, not a circle, he is able to formulate his three laws of planetary motion in the early decades of the 17th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kepler's first law of planetary motion\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have an image of the Earth and all the other planets moving in circular orbits, with the Sun sitting at the center. This is actually a fairly good picture -- the Earth's orbit around the Sun, for example, is very close to that of a circle. However, if you start taking accurate measurements, you will eventually see that the orbits of the planets are not exactly circular. This was the first key fact that Kepler discovered, and is encoded in his first law of planetary motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Planets move along elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this mean exactly? First, the orbits are ellipses, rather than circles. You can think of an ellipse as a circle that has been \"squashed\" in one direction, so it is bigger in one direction than it is in the perpendicular direction. Although there is still a central point after this squashing, it turns out there are two special points called *focal points* or *foci* (the plural of *focus*). \n",
    "\n",
    "The following video does a good job of not only showing you how to draw an ellipse using the foci and a piece of string, but it also shows the meaning of the term *major axis* for the ellipse."

Since the planet is closest to the Sun on the right-hand side, the wedge is not so long in the left-right direction. On the left side, when the planet is furthest away from the Sun, it has the longest wedge. For these two areas to be the same in the same amount of time, on the right-hand side, the planet has to be traveling the fastest, while on the left-hand side, it must be traveling at its slowest.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step for our simulation will be to create the Sun, as well as the Earth and Mars in orbit around it. The code below\n",
    "\n",
    "Make the following additions to your code before you run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the equation for the orbital speed of an object in a circular motion to define `V_EARTH` and `V_MARS` (both in PAU / Pyr). Although you can type in the actual number, you can also use the pre-defined values `R_EARTH`, `R_MARS` and `GM_SUN` along with the appropriate equation to have the computer calculate the speeds for you.\n",
    "1. Define `MAX_TIME` as the length of the Earth's orbital period in Pyr. Again, you can have the computer calculate the exact value, if you wish.\n",
    "1. Earlier, you defined the speeds `V_EARTH` and `V_MARS`, and the starting positions `Earth.pos` and `Mars.pos` are already given. Use this information to properly define the initial velocities `Earth.velocity` and `Mars.velocity` above the `while` loop. Remember that these velocites should be perpendicular to the position vectors for the Earth and Mars. In addition, make sure your planets travel in a counter-clockwise direction!\n",
    "1. Finally, the most important part is to add the gravitational acceleration of the two planets. Remember that the *acceleration* ${\\vec g}$ (rather than the *force*) on an object at a position ${\\vec r}$ from a mass $M$ is given by\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "        {\\vec g} = - \\frac{GM}{r^2} {\\hat r}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    where ${\\hat r}$ is the unit vector in the same direction as the position vector ${\\vec r}$. You can calculate the unit vector for a Python vector `r` by using `norm(r)`, and the magnitude of `r` using `mag(r)`. The position vector for the two planets will be their distance away from the Sun; however, the Sun is located at the origin, so you will only need to use the vectors `Earth.pos` and `Mars.pos`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make all the additions in the code listed above, and then run the cell. If everything is correct, you should see the Earth and Mars traveling around the Sun in circular orbits in the time it takes for the Earth to go around once. Verify that this is true, or work on your code until everything works properly."

    "## What is not included here\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell above, the Earth is only affected by the gravitational force from the Sun, and the same for Mars. This means there are several forces missing: the force between the Earth and Mars, and the forces of the planets acting on the Sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may consider the effect of the Earth on the Sun to be negligible, and it is very small, but it is not zero. Although we have assumed here that the Earth and Mars orbit around the center of the Sun, this is actually not true. If we look at only the Earth and the Sun, the two objects <b>both</b> orbit around their common center of mass. Remember that the center of mass for the Earth and Sun is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec r}_{CM} = \\frac{M_{Sun} {\\vec r}_{Sun} + m_{Earth} {\\vec r}_{Earth}}{M_{sun} + m_{Earth}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Find the distance between the center of the Sun and the center of mass for the Earth-Sun system. The mass of the Earth is $5.97 \\times 10^{24}$ kg, and the distance between their centers is about 149.6 million km; the mass of the Sun was given earlier in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** The center of mass you found in the last problem is actually deep inside the Sun, which has a radius of $6.96 \\times 10^5$ km. However, the Sun does orbit around this point over the course of one year! Figure out the tangential speed of the Sun's center as it orbits in a circular path around the Earth-Sun center of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most successful methods of discovering exoplanets -- planets orbiting around other stars besides the Sun -- is called the **radial velocity** method, which detects this slight motion of the main star due to planets orbiting around it. In fact, the first detection of a planet around a Sun-like star used this method, and was the subject of the 2019 Nobel Prize in physics. The current state of the art is able to detect stellar motions of a few m/s, so an Earth-like body could not be detected by this method now. However, objects with much larger masses (such as the size of Jupiter) and closer to the star are readily observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other force not included in your simulation is the gravitational force between the Earth and Mars. Again, this will be a small effect, but an analogous force has been used to verify the existence of exoplanets. This is because the forces between planets give rise to small changes in the time each planet orbits the star. These **timing variations** have been seen in exoplanet systems where the planets are very close to the main star, and thus a lot closer to each other than the Earth and Mars ever come.\n",

    "## Sending a rocket from the Earth to Mars\n",
    "\n",
    "Your next step will be to create a rocket that travels from the Earth to Mars along a Hohmann transfer orbit. Remember that this is an elliptical orbit between the two circular orbits of the planets. In other words, the closest point of the transfer orbit is at the same radius as the Earth, and the furthest point of the transfer orbit is the same radius as Mars.\n",

    "**Problem:** Convert the time to travel along the transfer orbit from Earth to Mars into Pyr.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simulate the motion of a rocket from the Earth to Mars, you will need to complete the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a sphere object called `rocket` in the place indicated in the cell above, with an initial position the same as the Earth's. You can give the rocket a trail (as the Earth and Mars have) so you can see its orbit more easily. The rocket should have the initial speed in PAU/Pyr you just calculated so that the rocket will travel in a transfer orbit towards the orbit of Mars. Remember that the initial *velocity* must be in the same direction that the Earth is traveling!\n",
    "1. Update `rocket.velocity` and `rocket.pos` inside the `while` loop, just like is done for the Earth and Mars.\n",
    "1. Change `MAX_TIME` so that it is the time (in Pyr) for the rocket to travel from the Earth to Mars.\n",
    "1. If you wish, change `scene.camera.follow()` so that the simulation follows the motion of `rocket` instead of `Earth`.\n",
    "1. If you do this correctly, the rocket should touch the orbit of Mars in the time (in Pyr) you figured out above at the time `MAX_TIME`. However, Mars will not be there at the same time!\n",
    "1. You need to change the initial position of Mars by changing the angle `Q_Mars` so that the planet will be in the right location when the rocket reaches its orbital distance. **Hint:** The rocket arrives at Mars' orbit at $(-1, 0, 0)$, corresponding to the angle `Q = pi`. Thus, if you want Mars to be in the right place, you need to calculate the starting angle `Q_Mars` so that Mars is in the right spot 259 days later. You will need to use the orbital period of Mars in Pyr at the beginning of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of this is done, when you run the cell you should see your rocket successfully meet Mars -- that's one small step for you, one giant leap for mankind!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge: Staying on Mars and coming home\n",
    "\n",
    "The mission is not complete until the astronauts leave Mars and return to Earth for their ticker tape parade in New York City. Remember that this involves a wait on Mars (calculated with the Lesson 32 worksheet) before the rocket starts along the return transfer orbit back to the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "So your challenge is to finish the mission by (1) having the rocket stay on Mars for the right amount of time, and then (2) return to Earth. One easy way to do this is to define a variable `WAIT_TIME` and then add two separate `while` loops, one for each phase of the mission, using this variable. See if you can get all of this to work, so the rocket executes the total Earth-Mars-Earth trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the orbital speed or period of a satellite moving in a circular orbit around a planet of given mass.\n",
    "* Find the relationship between the orbital period and semi-major axis for an elliptical orbit."

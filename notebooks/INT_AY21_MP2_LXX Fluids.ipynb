    "Historically, one of the more important ideas in physics from the 18th and 19th centuries is the [kinetic theory of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases), which explains many of the properties of a gas by the simple model of assuming the gas is made of very small particles moving at random speeds. We will explore this idea a little as we motivate how the pressure of a fluid can change based on the depth the pressure is measured at. A good simulation to explore this model, and to review how it accounts for the various gas laws, is given in the next cell."

    "To keep things visually simple, we will use a two-dimensional gas, so you can see everything that is happening at all times. This means we will have disks representing the molecules of the gas inside of a square box. There are several things we need to do to set up this simulation:\n",

The function returns three lists: the list `disk_pos_list` of disk positions, a list `disk_vel_list` of their velocities, and then a list `disk_object_list` of the `cylinder` objects representing them in the animation. Since this is a relatively simple way of setting up the simulation, to make sure disks do not form on top of each other, the ratio `AREA_RATIO` of the area of the disks to the total area is kept small. The positions and velocities of the disks are also kept in a Python list, rather than directly creating the `cylinder` objects that will represent the atoms in our simulation. Using a list will help the animation run more smoothly. Run the cell below to use this function."

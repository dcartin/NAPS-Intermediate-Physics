    "So far, I have been avoiding a key part of physics. Over all of the lessons so far, we have talked about how and why objects move. Specifically, given the acceleration of an object, we can find its position and velocity; with Newton's laws, we can start to calculate acceleration ourselves! But what is doing the moving? In particular, when I say the position of an object has changed, what point of the object is has shifted? We have glossed over this part, but it is actually important to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that for motion in a line, instead of thinking of a given object as an extended mass -- that is, with some finite shape and size -- I can think of its mass as concentrated at a specific point. This point is called the \"center of mass\". All of the physics we have done so far is then describing the motion of this point because of interactions with other objects. Hopefully, this is an obvious statement, but it is something that has to be proven. In fact, this need for a proof is one of the reasons Newton developed calculus!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I was careful to say \"motion in a line\". When rotation gets involved, then the shape and size of the object become important again. However, for now we will ignore those complications. This lesson will introduce the concept of the center of mass, and how it applies to collisions in one dimension.\n",

    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the center of mass position and velocity of a group of objects.\n",
    "* Describe how Newton's 3rd law is equivalent to conservation of momentum for an isolated system.\n",
    "* Calculate the unknown mass or velocity of an object experiencing a collision in one dimension using conservation of momentum.\n",

If we consider the CM to be a specific point associated with an object, or system of objects, then we can define various quantities describing that point and its motion.

    "\n",
    "1. The collision happens when the two balls are closer than the sum of their radii. Thus, the check in the <code>if</code> statement is whether the distance `redBall.pos - greenBall.pos` between the positions of the balls (i.e. the distance between their *centers*) is less than `redBall.radius + greenBall.radius`. Since only the size of the distance matters, not the direction, the `if` statement uses `mag()` to find this size. It is not so important to do it this way for objects moving along a line, but will be more useful for 2D collisions.\n",
    "1. The final velocities of the red ball after the collision is given by ${\\vec v}_{R, f} = - \\epsilon {\\vec v}_{R, i}$, and similarly for the green sphere. This is why the constant `EPSILON` for the coefficient of restitution is defined at the beginning of the program.\n",

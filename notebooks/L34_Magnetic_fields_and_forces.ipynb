    "### Basics of mass spectrometer\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of a mass spectrometer is the following. You are given a substance you want to know the composition of. One way to do this is to ionize the material, so that all its component atoms and molecules have a net charge. Then the ions are sent through a <b>velocity selector</b>, which only lets ions with a fixed velocity through. As you will see below, this works by combining an electric field and a magnetic field inside the selector so that only ions with a given speed will move in a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this is done, the ions pass into a region with a different magnetic field. This field causes the ions to move in a semi-circle with a radius depending on their speed, charge and mass. Because the speed is the same for all the ions, the position of the ions depends only on their charge and mass, which can be used to identify that particular atom or molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will see how the velocity selector works to isolate ions of a given speed; later, you will see how the motion of the ions in a magnetic field depends on their physical attributes."

    "### The velocity selector\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important part of a mass spectrometer is the velocity selector. The code you will use for the selector is given below. There are several parts to the selector:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two electrodes on the top and bottom (the blue sides) that create an electric field pointing in the vertical direction as you see it.\n",
    "* There are two magnetic poles on the left and right (the red sides) that create a magnetic field pointing in the horizontal direction from your perspective.\n",
    "* Only charges that move straight through the selector are desired, so there are two barriers at the far end of the velocity selector (the white sides), forming a slit for the charges with the correct speed to move through.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember from Lesson XXX, one of the first things you did was have a ball bounce against a wall and rebound back. A version of this code is used inside the `while` to prevent the charge from passing through the walls, if the net force on it causes a change in direction. One new Python command --  the `break` command -- is used if the charge passes right through the slit in the two barriers. At this point, the `while` loop \"breaks\", or stops immediately. Otherwise the charge bounces off the barriers as it did the other walls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code, and watch the motion of the charged sphere as it moves down the velocity selector. Due to the choice of field magnitudes $E$ and $B$, and the charge's speed $v$, the charge bounces off the back barriers and does not make it through the selector."

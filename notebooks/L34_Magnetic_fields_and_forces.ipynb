    "## Magnetic fields\n",
    "\n",
    "I am now going to introduce the idea of a magnetic field. This is denoted by the symbol ${\\vec B}$. We have already covered two fields before -- the gravitational and electric fields -- and much of your intuition from those should carry over. In particular, the magnetic field is something that everyone agrees on; no matter how you measure the magnetic field, you will get the same answer for ${\\vec B}$ as any other observer. This is the central intuition you should always remember about *any* type of field. However, as we will see, magnetic fields are more complicated than the fields we have dealt with before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like the other fields, we can draw magnetic field lines for ${\\vec B}$. Remember that the direction of the electric field ${\\vec E}$ at a particular point is given by the direction of the electrostatic force ${\\vec F}_e$ on a positive charge placed at that point (*not* the direction of its velocity!). So we can imagine using a positive charge to map out the directions of the electric field, then connect these directions together to get electric field lines. We can do something similar with a magnetic field. As our operative definition, we have the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Direction of magnetic field\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "The direction of the magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ at a point $P$ is given by the direction the \"north\" end of a compass would point when placed at that point.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, just like an electric field, we can use a compass to map out the directions of the magnetic field at particular points, then stitch these directions together to get magnetic field lines. A wonderful demonstration of this (and standard fare at every elementary school!) to use to iron filings around a bar magnet, to show the field of the magnet. This works because the iron filings act like small compasses, so they map out the field very well.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see from the picture above, the bar magnet itself has two **magnetic poles**: north and south. The magnetic field lines go between the north and south poles. Outside of the bar magnet, the magnetic field lines go *from* the north pole *towards* the south pole. From our method of finding the direction of magnetic field lines from compasses, this means that the north pole of the compass is attracted to the south pole of the bar magnet. Much like charges, opposites attract!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Poles are not charges\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "Students often see this *analogous* behavior between electric charges and magnetic poles, and go forward and say that it is because they are *equal*. This is not true! Magnetic poles are not the same as electric charges. They display similar behaviors, regarding directions of forces and field lines, but they are distinct physical properties. In fact, we will see later that magnetic poles are created by the motion of electric charges.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also notice that the magnetic field lines never end. Instead they form loops, with each line starting at the north magnetic pole, extending outside the bar magnet to the south magnetic pole, then joining up again to itself back at the north pole. *Magnetic field lines have no beginnings or ends*. This is different than electric field lines, which start and stop at electric charges. This is a manifestation of a physical observation: there is no such thing as an isolated magnetic pole, they always come in north/south pairs. A single pole (or **magnetic monopole**) has never been seen, although there are theoretical reasons to expect that they may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of direction for the magnetic field lines has another interesting consequence. Remember that these field lines are given by which way the \"north\" end of a compass points. Because opposite poles of a magnet attract, this means that the north *geographic* pole of the Earth is where the south *magnetic* pole of the planet's magnetic field is! Our compass points (roughly) north because it is attracted to a south magnetic pole!\n",

    "The basic idea of a mass spectrometer is the following. You are given a substance you want to know the composition of. One way to do this is to ionize the material, so that all its component atoms and molecules have a net charge. Then the ions are sent through a <b>velocity selector</b>, which only lets ions with a fixed velocity through. As you will see below, this works by combining an electric field and a magnetic field inside the selector so that only ions with a given speed will move in a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this is done, the ions pass into a region with a different magnetic field. This field causes the ions to move in a semi-circle with a radius depending on their speed, charge and mass. Because the speed is the same for all the ions, the position of the ions depends only on their charge and mass, which can be used to identify that particular atom or molecule.\n",

    "If you remember from Lesson XXX, one of the first things you did was have a ball bounce against a wall and rebound back. A version of this code is used inside the `while` to prevent the charge from passing through the walls, if the net force on it causes a change in direction. One new Python command --  the `break` command -- is used if the charge passes right through the slit in the two barriers. At this point, the `while` loop \"breaks\", or stops immediately. Otherwise the charge bounces off the barriers as it did the other walls.\n",

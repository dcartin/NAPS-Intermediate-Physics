    "Now we start studying the idea of \"velocity\". You probably have an intuition of what this means, but this is one topic where the common ideas of what \"velocity\" and \"speed\" mean are not good enough for use in physics. Thus, it is really important to be aware of what the definitions of these quantities are, and how they differ from what we use in everyday speech. To set this up, first we need some other definitions.\n",

    "* What is the change in energy of a falling rock?\n",
    "* What is the voltage difference for an electron passing through a battery?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "To indicate a difference in the initial and final values of a quantity, we use the Greek letter capital delta $\\Delta$. This is always the final minus the initial values of the quantity. Thus, the difference in vertical position between the top and bottom of Ripley Hall is\n",

    "The first of the quantities we will define using the $\\Delta$ symbol is **displacement**. This is a vector quantity giving the distance between the starting (${\\vec r}_i$) and ending (${\\vec r}_f$) points, i.e. \"as the crow files\". Thus, it is an easy quantity to work with -- if an object moves through some path, to find the displacement, it does not matter what the path is, just the beginning and end of it. Obviously, objects can move through some very convoluted paths due to forces acting on them, so why is the particular trajectory not important? I can give you two answers for this, depending on the situation. For some, such as a basketball thrown out onto the court, the effect of gravity will result in only *one* possible path from your hands to where the ball lands; if I know the displacement of the ball, I can calculate everything else about the motion (such as time of flight, initial velocity). For other situations, this may not be clear. However, I can think of the complicated path as a big number of small displacements put together, one after the other. This is where using a computer is great -- I can tell the computer what the rules are for each displacement, and it will find the trajectory of the object. An example of this is if I threw a feather out on the court instead. If I tell the computer the rules for both gravity and air resistance, it can find the overall displacement as the sum of a bunch of individual pieces.\n",

Also, these are actually **vector** quantities; we know this because of the \"arrow\" sign above each of the symbols. For now, we are not going to worry too much about the idea of a vector -- we will explore these more in Lesson 04 (introduction to vectors). However, it will be important here to know that vectors have *direction*. Hopefully, you can already see this when you plug numbers into the equation above. If $r_{i, y} = 3$ and $r_{f, y} = 5$, then $\\Delta r_y = 2$, while if the initial and final numbers are reversed, then $\\Delta r_y = -2$. When the displacement $\\Delta r_y$ is *positive*, the object has moved in the positive direction, while the negative displacement means the motion was in the negative direction. So already, you can see how direction will be taken into account in physics quantities.\n",

    "When constructing a simulation of motion, the computer must be told how to calculate the position of an object. This process is known as **updating**. This will be a crucial part of what we do with vPython, so we will go through it in some detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set up what we are trying to do. We are going to give the computer information about the initial position and velocity of a sphere, i.e. the values at $t = 0$, and then tell it to calculate the position at later times. For now, we are assuming only constant speed motion in the $x$ direction, so we only want to calculate the position $r_x$. Since the computer cannot do an infinite number of calculations, we will give it a fixed time step value $\\Delta t$, and ask it to find the position $r_{1, x}$ at $t = \\Delta t$, then the position $r_{2, x}$ at $t = 2 \\Delta t$, and so on. Since we are only computing the position at integer numbers of time steps, we will label all of our quantities by the number of time steps that have passed, not the actual time. To find the time, you would then multiply the number of time steps by the size of the time step.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice what we have done with this problem. During *each* time step -- going from $t = n \\Delta t$ to $t = (n + 1) \\Delta t$, the ball has gone from an initial position $r_{n, x}$ to a final position $r_{n + 1, x}$. Since we are assuming that the velocity is constant, and in the $x$ direction, there will be a fixed velocity $v_x$. Technically, it doesn't matter if we use the velocity at $t = n \\Delta t$, or $t = (n + 1) \\Delta t$, or even $t = 0$! However, it will matter much more later in the course, so we are going to be a little careful about how we do this. Let's assume that we use the velocity at the beginning of each time step, i.e. $v_{n, x}$. This will be our average velocity, since the velocity is constant, meaning we can just use our equation from above in the $x$ direction:\n",

Notice that we start with a position $r_{n, x}$ and add a change $\\Delta r_{n, x}$ to it, so we know what the position is at the next time step.

We will call this very short time interval `DT`, which stands for the quantity $\\Delta t$. Since it does not change, it is written in capital letters, to emphasize it is constant. Eventually, we will tell the computer to repeatedly update the picture to be what it looks like a time `DT` later. In the context of the program, we are talking about virtual time (i.e. time in our virtual world); a virtual time interval of 1 second may take much less than one second on a fast computer. So, underneath the line of code you just added, type in\n",

    "Finally, we specify the velocity of the ball. We can make the velocity of the ball an attribute of the ball, by calling it `ball.velocity`. Since the ball will move in three dimensions, we must specify the $x, y$, and $z$ components of the ball's velocity. We do this by making `ball.velocity` a vector. We are only going to worry about the $x$ direction for now, though. Under the definition of the object `ball`, type in\n",

A `while` loop instructs the computer to keep executing a series of commands over and over again, until we tell it to stop. The program will exit the `while` loop when a logical test is satisfied.\n",

Also, remember that the computer knows which statements are inside the `while` because they are indented, so indent the code `ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity * dt` by using the Tab key. Finally, we need time to move forward inside the `while` loop (or it will never stop!) so add the statement `t = t + DT`.\n",

    "When the program reaches the `while` statement, the computer will check to see if the statement `t < MAX_TIME` is true. Remember that we have defined `MAX_TIME` to be 3 for this program. Since it is, it will run the two lines of code within the `while` loop in order, and then check again to see if `t < MAX_TIME` is true. The `while` loop will thus repeat, over and over, until `t` is greater than or equal to `MAX_TIME`. Since we are adding `DT` to `t` everytime the loop is repeated, eventually `t < MAX_TIME` will no longer be true. Once this happens, the program will move to the next thing after all of the statements in the `while` loop (which here is the end of the program, so the computer stops).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** One common error I often see is that students forget to include this statement that changes the time variable `t`. Then they run the program, and it looks like the computer has frozen! Instead, the computer is running exactly what you told it to, to change the position `ball.pos` but *not* the time. So the `while` loop never stops, since the condition `t < MAX_TIME` is always satisfied. Don't forget this part!\n",

    "\n",
    "Because computers are very fast, the ball moved so fast that you saw only a flash! To slow down the animation, insert the statement `rate(100)` inside the loop, just after the `while` statement, indented as usual. This specifies that the `while` loop will not be executed more than 100 times per second, even if your computer is capable of many more than 100 loops per second. The way it works is that each time around the loop VPython checks to see whether 1/100th of a second has elapsed since the previous iteration. If not, VPython waits until that much time has gone by. This ensures that there are no more than 100 iterations performed in one second.\n",

    "This lesson has three major pieces. The first dealt with the SI system of units, and dealt with building up derived units with prefixes, and converting between two different units. Along the way, we also talked about scientific notation and significant digits. We will be using all of these concepts throughout the year, so you need to maintain a solid grasp of using them. Remember to periodically review this material when it gets fuzzy. The second part covered displacement, as well as average and instantaneous velocity. These concepts were defined, and various relationships between them laid out. This includes how to get displacement from a velocity vs. time graph, and velocity from a position vs. time graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final part covered the vPython package, using it to create a `sphere` object. A good reference for this package is at [vPython.org](http://vpython.org). We talked about the attributes of objects like this, and how they can be defined. Then, from the definition of average velocity, the Euler method enabled us to animate the sphere, so it moved at a constant velocity. This included the use of a `while` loop for updating the position of the sphere. Finally, the position and velocity components of the sphere were graphed using the `graph` and `gcurve` modules in vPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert between different types of units, including SI and non-SI units, as well as units with prefixes.\n",
    "* Write a number in proper scientific notation, with the correct number of signficant figures.\n",
    "* Define average velocity and instantaneous velocity.\n",
    "* Describe the Euler method.\n",
    "* Create a sphere in vPython, and update its position.\n",

Unfortunately, this story is probably not true! What he did instead is more interesting, and leads to actual mathematical relationships dealing with acceleration and gravity.

Give the horizontal and vertical axes the labels \"Time (s)\" and \"v_|| (m/s)\", respectively. Then create a curve `velParCurve` using this new graph `velGraph`; pick your favorite color for the line!

    "# A puzzle: changing ramp angle\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can do something interesting. Suppose the ramp angle changes as the block moves along it? We can do this in vPython by having the ramp angle variable `Q` change as time evolves. However, as mentioned above, to do this we need to take into account how the `box` object is defined in vPython. The issue is that the position `pos` of a `box` object is at the center of the object. The `axis` attribute then will rotate around this center to the desired angle. But we want to do something different: imagining that there is a \"hinge\" on the bottom of the ramp, and rotating the ramp around that hinge. Thus, the rotation should be around one edge of the `box` object, not its center. Unfortunately, this issue makes the code more complicated, so below is everything that needs to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create the `ramp` object so that the center of its left-hand side is at the position `vector(0, 0, 0)` (i.e. the \"hinge\" is along the $+z$ axis pointing out of the screen). Putting it there will make it easier to change the ramp angle -- this is done by only changing the vector `ramp.axis`, which points \"up\" the ramp. Thus the actual center of the ramp is therefore half its $x$ length to the right; in vPython, this is\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ramp.pos = 0.5 * rampLength * unitPar\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both attributes `ramp.pos` and `ramp.axis` will be given in terms of the unit vector `unitPar`. Unlike before, this vector will change as the ramp angle variable `Q` changes.\n",
    "* Similarly, the box object `block` needs to be defined. Its position `block.pos` (at the center of the block) will be at the center of the ramp, but also shifted in the perpendicular direction, so the block is not *inside* the ramp. Therefore, `block.pos` is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "block.pos = 0.5 * rampLength * unitPar + 0.5 * blockHeight * unitPerp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The angle is continually updated in the evolution loop. For now, we will use a simple *angular speed*, given by the symbol $\\omega$ (\"omega\"), so that $\\Delta \\theta = \\omega \\Delta t$. We will see more of these types of equations when we discuss rotational kinematics in Lesson LESSON LINK.\n",
    "* Because of the changing angle, the unit vectors `unitPar` and `unitPerp` must be updated inside the `while` loop.\n",
    "* This also means that the position and axis of both `block` and `ramp` must be updated using the new unit vectors. Specifically, `ramp.pos` must be changed so that the left-hand side of the ramp (the \"hinge\") remains along the $+z$ axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the code is similar to what we have seen before, although `MAX_TIME` was reduced to 3, so that the block does not leave the ramp when we add in motion. If you run the code in the cell below, you will see the ramp start at $\\theta = 15.0^\\circ$, but the ramp angle increases with time. Because we are not including anything about velocity or forces, the block remains stationary in the center of the ramp."

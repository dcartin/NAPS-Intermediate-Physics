    "Now that you have velocity under the belt, it is time to move on to acceleration. On the one hand, acceleration is more abstract than velocity. This is because acceleration is defined in terms of the change in velocity with time, while velocity is the change in position over time. So acceleration is the change in the change in the position over a time interval. As you will see when you program an accelerating object into vPython, if you are not careful with all those changes, you will get incorrect motion! Related to this is some confusion about the relation between velocity and acceleration. Sometimes there is a notion that \"greater speed = greater acceleration\", which is not true. We will examine the relationship between velocity and acceleration in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, you are very familiar with the perfect example of acceleration we see everyday: the acceleration of a falling object. Our brains are wired to understand what happens when we drop a tennis ball, for example, for a small time vs. a large one. We know that if we want to catch a ball that has fallen for twice the time, we don't put our hand twice as low as we would for the short time, but roughly three times lower. The ball does not display the motion of something in constant velocity, but of an object with velocity changing at a constant rate.\n",

    "The idea of acceleration will tie all of this together. The plan is to define acceleration, and explore some of its aspects, then try to use this concept to model the motion of a ball moving vertically under the influence *only* of the gravitational force.

    "### From velocity to position\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's keep going, and use what we learned in [Lesson 03](vel-Euler:vel) about the relationship between velocity and change in position. Remember the task at hand: given the position $r_{n, y}$ and the velocity $v_{n, y}$ at a time $t = n \\Delta t$, we now want to find the position $r_{n + 1, y}$ when time has moved forward one time step, i.e. at time $t = (n + 1) \\Delta t$. We can already find the new velocity $v_{n + 1, y}$ at this new time, from the acceleration $a_y$ and the time step $\\Delta t$. We found there that the area under the curve for a velocity vs. time graph gives the change in position, so how do we calculate this area? The graphs below show three different possibilities.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may be asking yourself, \"Why are we using these rectangles? We know the slope is constant on this graph, why can't we use triangles?\" And you would be right -- in *this* particular case, where the acceleration is constant, we could use our knowledge of the problem and come up with a better scheme. However, what I am trying to do here is motivate our choice without assuming anything about the slope. What if the slope were changing? What would we do then? You will only have the initial and final velocities, calculated using your acceleration, to find the change in position, so we need to develop a good all-purpose method for that. You will see that our \"best choice\" in the case of constant acceleration is also a good choice when acceleration is changing. In fact, if you have seen integral calculus before, you can see that the methods we use here are the basis for defining the integral of a function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the graph above, the first method is to use the velocity $v_{n, y}$ at the old time $t = n \\Delta t$, and find the new position using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    v_{n, y} = \\frac{r_{n + 1, y} - r_{n, y}}{\\Delta t} \\Rightarrow r_{n + 1, y} = r_{n, y} + v_{n, y} \\Delta t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After the new position is found, then we can also find the new velocity using the acceleration. In vPython code, this might look like\n",

    "```python\n",
    "ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity * DT\n",
    "ball.velocity = ball.velocity + ball.accel * DT\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the `+=` operator, then this can be shortened to\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ball.pos += ball.velocity * DT\n",
    "ball.velocity += ball.accel * DT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking in terms of graphs and areas, this equation would give us the graph shown on the left-hand side. However, notice that the blue rectangles give us too small of an area -- there are \"missing triangles\" all along the red line. Physically, the interpretation is that the initial velocity $v_{n, y}$ is \"too slow\", and so the dropped ball is lagging behind where it should be along its path.\n",
    "\n",
    "For second method, instead of using the initial velocity, we find the final velocity ${\\vec v}_{n + 1}$ *first*, and then use it to find the new position. In equations, this would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    v_{n + 1, y} = \\frac{r_{n + 1, y} - r_{n, y}}{\\Delta t} \\Rightarrow r_{n + 1, y} = r_{n, y} + v_{n + 1, y} \\Delta t\n",

    "    ball.pos += ball.velocity * DT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the code looks very similar to the code above! All I have done is switched the order of these two statements. This is why the order of programming lines can be important. The first line updates `ball.velocity` to find $v_{n + 1, y}$, and with this updated `ball.velocity`, then uses it to find the new position `ball.pos`. This updating method is sometimes referred to as the **Euler-Cromer** method. If you go back to Cromer's original paper on the method, he says that the method was discovered by a student accidently reversing the two lines! We will frequently use this method of updating ${\\vec r}$ and ${\\vec v}$, since it works rather well for its simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, looking at the right-hand graph in the figure above, you see there is still a problem -- now there are \"extra triangles\", and the area is too big. This means that we are using too large of a velocity, and the dropped ball is further along the path than it should be. This leads to the final method of updating, which is to take how we defined velocity seriously. Remember that the equation\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec v}_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta {\\vec r}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "says to use the *average* velocity when finding the change in position $\\Delta {\\vec r}$. For an object moving with constant acceleration -- and thus with velocity changing at a constant rate -- the average velocity is simply\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec v}_{avg} = \\frac{1}{2} ({\\vec v}_i + {\\vec v}_f)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For our case, this means that we update the position using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    r_{n + 1, y} = r_{n, y} + \\frac{1}{2} (v_{n, y} + v_{n + 1, y}) \\Delta t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the middle graph in the figure above, you'll see that this is the \"Goldilocks\" solution. This is known as the **midpoint approximation**. Although there are both missing and extra triangles on either side of the velocity vs. time curve, they cancel out, giving us the correct answer for the change in position $\\Delta r_{n, y}$ from $r_{n, y}$ to $r_{n + 1, y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this into programming code, it means that we have to save the old value $v_{n, y}$ of the velocity before we update it. If you think about it, there is no other way to order the two lines of code. Thus, the vPython implementation would be something like\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ball.oldvel = vector(ball.velocity)\n",
    "ball.velocity += ball.accel * DT\n",
    "ball.pos += + 0.5 * (ball.oldvel + ball.velocity) * DT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The midpoint approximation is more accurate than the Euler-Cromer method, but often, we can just use Euler-Cromer and not notice the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one way to make *any* of these methods work better is to decrease the size of the time step. If the rectangles are not as wide, the missing triangles become smaller as well, and the answer gets closer to the right one. This is essentially what is going on when we find the instantaneous velocity or acceleration -- by making $\\Delta t \\to 0$, we \"find the slope\" at a single time, rather than the average over a finite length of time. In terms of computation, reducing the time step `DT` makes the calculations more accurate, but also increases the number of such steps that must be done. There is a lot of effort in computational physics to find smarter ways of increasing the accuracy of simulations without slowing them down greatly. We will see some other methods of how this is done in future lessons."

So we need some way of dealing with the collision of the ball with the ground. One natural choice is for the ball to reverse the direction of its motion when it hits the ground. This means that if the vertical position of `ball` is now at or below the top surface of `ground`, then the vertical velocity component `ball.velocity.y` must switch signs (remember this scalar multiplication by $-1$ is how we switch the direction of a vector component 180$^\\circ$).\n",

Note that we are not sure that the ball will hit the $y$ position of the ground *exactly* during some part of the `while` loop, so we check to see only if it has gone beyond the ground. You may notice that in some cases, the ball looks like it sinks partway into the ground! It is possible to deal with collisions in a more sophisticated way than we do here, but I will not worry about this further."

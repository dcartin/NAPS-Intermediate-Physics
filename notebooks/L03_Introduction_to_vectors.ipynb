    "Many of the things we do in physics will depend on the idea of a \"vector\", so it is very important to understand the difference between a vector and a \"scalar\". Intuitively, a scalar is just a number. If we put units on a scalar, some examples would be the time of day you are reading this, and the temperature in the room where you are reading it. A vector, on the other hand, can be best thought of as an arrow -- a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude (size) and direction. The velocity of an object is a vector, since it has a size (how fast are you moving?) and a direction (which way are you moving?).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to describe a vector, and this lesson will hopefully give you a handle on these. First, you can go back to the idea of a vector as an arrow, and draw these on paper to see how to add or subtract them. This will be the idea behind \"graphical vector addition\". This technique is great for giving you a rough idea of the size and direction of a vector. We will use graphical vector addition frequently in this context -- for example, when we draw the \"free body diagram\" of the forces acting on an object in Lesson 13 (Solving force problems). We will also draw the \"vector diagram\" of many vectors, in order to find their \"vector components\". This is the second, and more mathematical, way of describing vectors. The components of a vector tell you how much of the vector is along each axis. This will also allow you to calculate the sum of multiple vectors. As a way to tie these two methods together, you will also see how to draw vectors in vPython. In particular, you will see that the codes using the mathematical relations gives you the graphical addition of arrows we would expect.\n",

    "I will now draw representations of vectors as arrows. Each arrow will point in the same direction as the vector, and I will scale the arrow to show the size of the vector. It is this last part you have to be careful about -- many different kinds of quantities are vectors, so don't get too wrapped up in the idea of \"magnitude = length\". This is why I used the word *scale* before. I can draw an arrow to represent a force vector, where 1 centimeter of arrow length on my drawing denotes 10.0 N of force magnitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** The reason I emphasize this here is that sometimes you will draw multiple vectors -- representing *different* quantities -- in the same problem, and if you confuse every vector with a length (or each other!), you will have problems. One place I see this a lot is when doing projectile motion problems (Lesson 07). Here, you may have an initial velocity vector to show how a cannonball is launched from a cannon, and a displacement vector giving its final position relative to its start. These vectors are *not* the same! They are generally not in the same direction, either. However, I sometimes see students calculate the final position of a cannonball using the initial velocity. Projectiles do not move in straight lines, because of the gravitational field of the Earth. Confusing your vectors will lead to this false conclusion.\n",

This urban plan helped New York City deal with its exponential growth in population during the 19th century; the five boroughs together were the largest city in the US by 1835. If we ignore some of the rough spots in the grid (due to either history, or living on an island that is not exactly a rectangle!), you can give the position of any street in Manhattan by two numbers: street and avenue. Throw in a height, and you have three numbers giving any spot in the island's airspace.\n",

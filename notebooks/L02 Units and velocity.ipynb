    "In this lesson, you will start with some basic definitions of physical quantities -- namely, velocity -- as well as the units of measurement used to quantify these. While you do this, you will also learn about the vPython package, and create moving objects in vPython. Often in a programming language, the command of the language must be supplemented to make more features available. The 3D graphics package vPython for the Python programming language was created by David Scherer while he was a student at Carnegie Mellon University. vPython allows you to create and animate 3D objects, and to navigate around in a 3D scene by spinning and zooming, using the mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need vPython? Why can't we just use the formulas and calculate things with them? My experience as a teacher is that many times, students see mathematical equations as a fancy machine that you put numbers into, then you get other numbers out of. What do they mean? I don't know!\n",

    "Sometimes it is the most ordinary things that can be important. One of these are the **units** you will use to explain what a given number means. If I tell you the distance is \"5\", what does that mean: 5 centimeters? 5 kilometers? 5 light-years? Those are very different measures of a length -- the first would be the life's journey of a tiny bacteria, the second a nice run in the morning, and the last is roughly the distance from the Sun to the nearest star system.\n",

    "In 1999 the Mars Climate Orbiter is believed to have either disintegrated in Mars' atmosphere, or bounced off into deep space, due to improper software code. One of the craft's programs output impulse measurements in \"ft lbs\" instead of the SI standard \"N s\". Physics teachers around the country are grateful that NASA spent $327 million for this shining example of why you should always watch your units!\n",
    "\n",
    "**SI units** were first developed during the French Revolution, but have come to be a system used globally. They are convenient, since conversions between many units for the same type of quantity use a power of 10. Here is a table of the **basic** units we will use this year. **Dimension** is the basic physical quantity that is being measured, while the **unit** is how the dimension is measured.\n",

    "| time             | second (s)        |\n",
    "| electric current | ampere (A)        |\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference between dimension and unit, notice that I can measure the same *dimension* in different *units* -- time can be measured in seconds, hours, or years. In addition, we will later built up other units from combinations of these basic units (for example, velocity is measured in meters per second).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, you have a good sense of what a second is, but maybe not the same intuition for a meter or a kilogram. My height is a little bit less than two meters; this is roughly the same as the distance from fingertip to fingertip when I fully stretch out my arms. A two liter bottle of soda has a mass of two kilograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these units are not always so useful. For example, what is the typical diameter of an atom? What is the mass of a new Ford-class aircraft carrier? The diameter would be a really *small* number, and the mass a very *large* one. To built up better units, we can glue a **prefix** onto the front of the basic unit. Some common prefixes are listed in the table below; this list -- with the power, prefix, and abbrevation, must be *memorized*!\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Important:** The one error I see students make over and over is to use the prefix table above incorrectly. Often they try to \"think too much\" about it, and thus flip the sign of the exponent in the power of ten. Here's how you should think of this: *the prefix is the same as the power of ten*. In other words, you can replace one with the other, and not change anything. Thus, for example,\n",

    "> 1 milligram = $10^{-3}$ grams\n",

    "> So, the \"milli\" is replaced by \"$10^{-3}$\" to get an equivalent amount.\n",

    "So how do they work? Suppose we want to find out how many kiloseconds there are in one microsecond. Our process is the following:\n",

    "* Write our given amount and unit in the numerator and 1 in the denominator.\n",

Also, note the \"one with the prefix\" is not always on the top or the bottom, it is where it needs to be to cancel out other units, or to give the desired unit at the end. The second part has microseconds in the bottom, to cancel the first one in the top; the third part  has kiloseconds in the top, since that is what we want at the end!\n",

A greater number of significant figures means the number has been measured to a higher precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb to use to find the number of sig figs a number has is to think about whether the number had to be written, or whether it is acting as a \"placeholder\" such as zero often does. To spell this out, here are some guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All non-zero digits are significant: 3.1415 has 5 sig figs, while 3.1 has only 2.\n",
    "* Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 50009 has 5 sig figs, and 1.01 has 3.\n",
    "* Leading zeros (left of the first non-zero digits) are *not* significant: 0.0999 and 0.0102 both have 3 sig figs.\n",
    "* Trailing zeros when no decimal place is present are not *necessarily* significant: 330 may have 2 or 3 sig figs, while 590,100 has 4, 5, or 6.\n",
    "* They *are* significant if a decimal place is written: 330. has 3 sig figs, and 590,100. has 6.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Updating position\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important parts to constructing a simulation of motion is telling the computer how to calculate the position of an object. This process is known as **updating**. This will be a crucial part of what we do with vPython, so we will go through it in some detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set up what we are trying to do. We are going to give the computer information about the initial position and velocity of a sphere, i.e. the values at $t = 0$, and then tell it to calculate the position at later times. For now, we are assuming only constant speed motion in the $x$ direction, so we only want to calculate the position $r_x$. Since the computer cannot do an infinite number of calculations, we will give it a specific time step $\\Delta t$, and ask it to find the position at $t = \\Delta t$, then at $t = 2 \\Delta t$, and so on. Since we are only computing the position at integer numbers of time steps, we will label all of our quantities by the number of time steps that have passed, not the actual time. To find the time, you would then multiply the number of time steps by the size of the time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, what we need to do is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> At time $t = n \\Delta t$, the position of the sphere is at $r_{n, x}$. Find the position of the sphere at the next time step, i.e. at $t = (n + 1) \\Delta t$, find the position $r_{n + 1, x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice what we have done with this problem. During *each* time step -- going from $t = n \\Delta t$ to $t = (n + 1) \\Delta t$, the ball has gone from an initial position $r_{n, x}$ to a final position $r_{n + 1, x}$. Since we are assuming that the velocity is constant, and in the $x$ direction, there will be a fixed velocity $v_x$. Technically, it doesn't matter if we use the velocity at $t = n \\Delta t$, or $t = (n + 1) \\Delta t$, or even $t = 0$! However, it will matter much more later in the course, so we are going to be a little careful about how we do this. Let's assume that we use the velocity at the beginning of each time step, i.e. $v_{n, x}$. This will be our average velocity, since the velocity is constant, meaning we can just use our equation from above in the $x$ direction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec v}_{avg} = \\frac{{\\vec r}_f - {\\vec r_i}}{t_f - t_i} \\Rightarrow v_{n, x} = \\frac{r_{n + 1, x} - r_{n, x}}{\\Delta t}\n",

Later on in the course, we will see some slightly more sophisticated updating methods, but this will work for simple cases.\n",

Because this object has a constant speed, the graph is of a straight, horizontal line. However, the graph also includes an interpretation for our updating equation above. Notice that we start with a position $r_{n, x}$ and add a change $\\Delta r_{n, x}$ to it, so we know what the position is at the next time step. If you look at the Euler method equation, hopefully you can see that this change is simply given by\n",

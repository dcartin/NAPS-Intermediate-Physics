    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, one of the most powerful methods used to understand a situation is the use of conservation methods. Remember that these are cases where we can say some physical quantity for a system stays the same, regardless of any kind of interactions between components of the system. Knowing that something remains constant, even when you do not know all the details of what is happening to the system, allows you to find out a lot about the system's evolution. We have seen two conservation laws already -- the conservation of linear momentum (when there is no net external force), the conservation of angular momentum (no external torque). This lesson and the next are now working towards the third: the conservation of mechanical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good time to take stock of what we have covered so far, and what is coming up next. At this point, we have discussed *forces* and *momentum* (both linear and angular). The idea of a force is inituitively obvious -- you probably have a sense of it as a \"push\" or a \"pull\". You might have noticed that we never gave a rigorous definition of what a force is, just a list of common forces, and this seems to be a satisfactory way of proceding. Newton's second law then built a bridge between forces and momentum, with net forces acting on an object changing the momentum of that object. We wrote down a mathematical definition of momentum, but the tie-in with Newton's laws gives us an notion of momentum as a measure of the object's *inertia*, its tendency to remain at a constant velocity unless acted on by outside forces. Using forces allows us to find the acceleration of an object, and the kinematic equations then give the complete motion of the object over a given time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike forces and momentum, the idea of energy is not as intuitive. I can feel the force of the wall as I lean against it; I do not \"see\" the force of gravity, but I *can* see its effect on anything I let go of; friction and air resistance are so familiar that we automatically expect objects to slow down to a stop, and we may quietly think that inertia doesn't quite make sense! However, I can't see how the energy of a dropped object changes as it falls, or that of a car braking to a stop. So what is energy?\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture I have in my head when I think of energy is that of accounting and money. If there is something I want, there are three ways that I can get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I can barter with you, i.e. trade you another physical object that you want.\n",
    "* I can give you something, like gold or silver coins, which everyone has decided is a \"store of value\". In other words, we usually do not need the coins themselves, but they are a *representation* of a certain utility to the person who currently has them.\n",
    "* I can use my credit card to buy the item. When I use the card, my bank will decrease the size of a particular number on its computer, and your bank will increase the size of another number on its computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To me, energy is this last sense of money -- in physics, we can attach certain numbers to objects, and these numbers change based on the motion of the object. By themselves, these numbers may be abstract, but as we will see, physicists have chosen the numbers well. Increasing or decreasing these numbers will represent physical processes, much like changing the number for my credit card buys my weekly groceries! So yes, energy is not something I can \"put a finger on\", but it is tied to motions that I can observe. We will see that energy methods are very powerful, and are useful in a variety of situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson sets the stage for energy by defining *work* and *kinetic energy*; the next lesson will define *potential energy* and *mechanical energy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",

    "\n",
    "To get a start into energy methods, it is usual to start with the notion of **work**. Unfortunately, this is a word that we use in everyday language to mean many things, but in physics, it has a very particular definition, given below, so it is very important to make sure you use the term properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Work transfers energy either into ($W > 0$) or out of ($W < 0$) a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, this may seem a bit circular, since we have not defined \"energy\" yet, but as we will see next, the mathematical definition of work includes forces acting over a distance. For now, think of it using our credit card analogy from above -- work is like using the card to buy something, and changes numbers in our \"energy\" bank accounts that we will define later. Positive work will increase the energy of the system, while negative work will decrease the system's energy.\n",

    "> **Important point:** Let's be careful about what the work-energy theorem is saying. We are assuming that we have some kind of object, with a center of mass position ${\\vec r}_{CM}$. Because of a combination of *external* forces, this CM position can accelerate at ${\\vec a}_{CM}$. So, in other words, we are not worrying about any internal forces, e.g. between parts of the object pushing against each other as it moves faster or slower. Thus, whenever I define a net work using the last equation, I am really talking about the *center of mass* work on the object. At this point, you may think I am being very picky over something that doesn't matter. For now, you would be right! However, when there are other changes to the system -- e.g. the object changes size, volume or internal energy (temperature) -- then net work may alter more than just the kinetic energy. There is also another general point: whenever you see a derivation, always know what the assumptions are, since they might not always be true!\n",
    "\n",
    "So we now have our first form of energy -- kinetic energy is a number related to the motion of an object. In addition, the net work shows how this quantity changes. A positive net work increases the kinetic energy of the system, while a negative net work decreases it. When there is no net work, the kinetic energy remains the same. This is the reason I said at the beginning of this lesson that work is the flow of energy into or out of the system.\n",

    "So far, I have been avoiding a key part of physics. Over all of the lessons so far, we have talked about how and why objects move. Specifically, given the acceleration of an object, we can find its position and velocity; with Newton's laws, we can start to calculate acceleration ourselves! But what is doing the moving? In particular, when I say the position of an object has changed, what point of the object is has shifted? We have glossed over this part, but it is actually important to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that for motion in a line, instead of thinking of a given object as an extended mass -- that is, with some finite shape and size -- I can think of its mass as concentrated at a specific point. This point is called the \"center of mass\". All of the physics we have done so far is then describing the motion of this point because of interactions with other objects. Hopefully, this is an obvious statement, but it is something that has to be proven. In fact, this need for a proof is one of the reasons Newton developed calculus!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I was careful to say \"motion in a line\". When rotation gets involved, then the shape and size of the object become important again. We will ignore those complications. This lesson will introduce the concept of the center of mass, and how it applies to collisions in one dimension.\n",

Your grade is a \"weighted average\" of what you earn on various assessments. In the same vein, the \"center of mass\" (or CM) is also a weighted average, but now over the mass in an object.

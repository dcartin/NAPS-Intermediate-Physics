    "The field of astronomy has the longest history of the observational and mathematical sciences. Even before written records began, there is evidence that humans were looking upward, as seen in cave paintings and the positioning of physical objects (such as Stonehenge). All the major ancient civilizations -- Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China -- have records of astronomical observations. Depending on the time and place, these were used for timekeeping, such as knowing when to plant crops, as well for divination, with the idea that events in the sky predict those on the Earth. These civilizations, to varying degrees, also started to uses mathematics to predict the motions of stars and planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most developed mathematical models was by Hipparchus of Nicea in the 2nd century BC, based on Babylonian astronomical data and the previous work of Apollonius of Perga about a century before. Hipparchus had to develop what we now know as trigonometry in order to calculate the motion of the Sun and the Moon, as seen from the Earth. His observations were later used by Claudius Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD for his famous astronomical textbook, now known as the *Almagest* from its Arabic translation of the original Greek title.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ptolemaic system and observations were used for centuries, but eventually two problems developed with them. The first is that it was assumed that the stars are fixed on a \"celestial sphere\", and do not move relative to each other. This is not actually true, and over two thousand years, these slight changes become noticeable. The second is that astronomical observations became more accurate, with the development of better instruments. In particular, inspired by earlier observatories in Baghdad and Istanbul, the Danish nobleman Tycho Brahe built in 1576 a large observatory on the island of Hven (now part of Sweden). His measurements of planetary and stellar positions were the best up to that time, and they showed problems with the mathematical models of the time.\n",

    "At that time, there were two competing models for the motion of planets in the Solar System. The *geocentric model*, espoused by Claudius Ptolemy and others, placed the Earth at the center, with Sun, Moon, and planets moving in orbits around it. There was also the *heliocentric model*, which moved the Sun to the center, with the Earth in an orbit around it, just like the other planets. The latest version of this had been proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus, using measurements by Greek and Arab astronomers; this is published just before his death in 1543. However, both of these models based their systems on circular orbits. This had been refined, by imagining circles placed on circles, to get more complicated motions. However, even these modifications still predicted slightly different planetary motions than what was observed.\n",

    "Thus, at the turn of the 17th century, there was a conflict between astronomical observations and the mathematical models trying to predict them. This is where Johannes Kepler stepped in, using Brahe's data in an attempt to clarify the situation. His goal was to use some version of the Copernican system for a heliocentric model, and chose the planet Mars to study specifically. In one way, this was a bad choice -- for many years, he made no progress in getting the motion of Mars to match a Copernican model. We now know this is because Mars is a bad match with the assumption of a perfectly circular orbit. However, in the end, Mars was the key, since it eventually led him to lay down his three laws of planetary motion. These laws, and some of their consequences, are the topic of this lesson.\n",

    "You might have an image of the Earth and all the other planets moving in circular orbits, with the Sun sitting at the center. This is actually a fairly good picture -- the Earth's orbit around the Sun, for example, is very close to that of a circle. However, if you start taking accurate measurements, you will eventually see that the orbits of the planets are not exactly circular. This was the first key fact that Kepler discovered, and is encoded in his first law of planetary motion.\n",

    "So what does this mean exactly? First, the orbits are ellipses, rather than circles. You can think of an ellipse as a circle that has been \"squashed\" in one direction, so it is bigger in one direction than it is in the perpendicular direction. Although there is still a central point after this squashing, it turns out there are two special points called **focal points** or **foci** (the plural of **focus**). The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to both focal points is always a constant, which you can see in the video linked at this point in Lesson 23 on [dcartin.github.io](https://dcartin.github.io/). It also shows the meaning of the term \"major axis\" for the ellipse. The **major axis** of an ellipse is the longest diameter of the ellipse, and passes through both the focal points. The constant sum of distances is just the major axis."

The distance from the left side to the right is the major axis. However, more important for our purposes will be half of this distance, known as the **semi-major axis**. The semi-major axis is denoted by the symbol $a$, so the major axis shown in the figure is twice that, or $2a$. Think about what would happen if the ellipse became more circular -- the semi-major axis would be exactly the same as the radius of the circle! So, for a lot of things we talk about below, the semi-major axis $a$ will replace the radius of a circle that we usually use. We will see this in more detail in the next section."

    "Again, we have a planet moving in an elliptical orbit around the Sun (based on the first law). Suppose we divide the period of the planet's orbit -- which would be one year for the Earth -- into twelve \"months\", and draw a line between the planet and the Sun at the beginning of each month. Then Kepler's 2nd law says that the area of each of these wedges is exactly the same. So what does this mean? Since the planet is closest to the Sun on the right-hand side, the wedge is not so long in the left-right direction. On the left side, when the planet is furthest away from the Sun, it has the longest wedge. For these two areas to be the same in the same amount of time, on the right-hand side the planet has to be traveling the fastest, while on the left-hand side it must be traveling at its slowest.\n",

    "The gravitational force ${\\vec F}_{SP}$ on the planet points towards the Sun, from Newton's law of universal gravitation, as seen in [Lesson 21](grav). The position vector ${\\vec r}_P$ of the planet also points towards the Sun. Because of this, the net torque on the planet ${\\vec \\tau} = {\\vec r}_P \\times {\\vec F}_{SP} = {\\vec 0}$ since the two vectors are parallel; gravitation is a central force (see [Lesson 18](ang-mom:cent-force)). With zero net torque, the angular momentum $L_P$ of the planet as it orbits the Sun is conserved. Now let's use this fact to show that conservation of angular momentum gives us Kepler's second law of planetary motion. This says that the area $\\Delta A$ swept out by a line from the planet $P$ to the Sun $S$ is the same for every time period $\\Delta t$. So, for a small time $\\Delta t$, the area is really close to a triangle, as you can see from the diagram below.\n",

It turns out the for only a inverse-square law force like gravity (i.e. one that depends on radius as $1/r^2$), there is a special property that allows this. You may remember that in Lesson 18 (uniform circular motion), we derived the equation $a_{cp} = v^2 / r$ for centripetal acceleration by using a \"velocity circle\" -- a graph showing how the end of the velocity vector travels in time. If an object moves due to gravity in a circular orbit, then this velocity circle is centered on the origin. It turns out that, for an *elliptical* orbit, the velocity vector still makes a circle, just shifted away from the origin.

This is essentially the same simulation we did previously with central forces in [Lesson 16 (circular motion)](UCM:cent-force), except I have adapted it to the gravitational force. The large object has a mass 100 times larger than the small one; to make things easily visible, I have made the objects' radii very small, even though this is not physically realistic! In addition, there is a graph of the effective potential energy $U_{eff}$ for the gravitational force (as the blue curve), along with the mechanical energy $E$ of the system (the green line). Run the program, and notice how the motion shown matches the $U_{eff}$ vs. $r$ graph. Remember that the gap between the mechanical energy and the effective potential energy is the radial kinetic energy, i.e. the part of the kinetic energy dependent on $v_r$. This shows how fast the small object is moving towards or away from the larger one."

    "Although Kepler's original formulation of his three laws of planetary motion were more about relationships between quantities, they provided a way of unifying how all the planets move into a single theoretical framework. When Newton came along later and sought to bring together all types of motion, his success in deriving Kepler's laws was a major selling point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you write Kepler's second law in terms of angular momentum, and the third law as a relation between period and semi-major axis, re then you can go far in calculating important quantities in both astronomy and space travel. For example, if you want to travel by spacecraft from one planet to another, you use Kepler's laws to find the necessary transfer orbit between the two, and the time it takes to travel along this orbit. As we saw with the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, knowing the details of an orbiting object gives you the mass of the primary it orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also help understand unseen objects as well. The 2020 Nobel Prize in physics was given in part to two researchers who observed the motions of stars at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, of which the Solar System is a part. These stars are orbiting an object known to astronomers as Sgr A$^*$ (\"Sgr\" is the abbreviation for the constellation of Sagittarius, where the object appears in the Earth's sky). Although Sgr A$^*$ is a source of radio waves, it does not emit much light in the visible range. However, using Kepler's third law and the motions of the stars around it, the mass of Sgr A$^*$ can be calculated. It was these motions that gave the first conclusive proof that this object is in fact a supermassive black hole, with an estimated mass of about four million times that of the Sun. You can find out more by visiting the [website for the research group](http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ghezgroup/gc/) of one of the Nobel laurates, Andrea Ghez, including movies and animations of the stellar motions around Sgr A$^*$.\n",

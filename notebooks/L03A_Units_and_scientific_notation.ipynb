    "Sometimes it is the most ordinary things that can be important. One of these are the **units** you will use to explain what a given number means. If I tell you the distance is \"5\", what does that mean: 5 centimeters? 5 kilometers? 5 light-years? Those are very different measures of a length -- the first would be the life's journey of a tiny bacteria, the second a nice run in the morning, and the last is roughly the distance from the Sun to the nearest star system.\n",

    "In 1999 the Mars Climate Orbiter is believed to have either disintegrated in Mars' atmosphere, or bounced off into deep space, due to improper software code. One of the craft's programs output impulse measurements in \"ft lbs\" instead of the SI standard \"N s\". Physics teachers around the country are grateful that NASA spent $327 million for this shining example of why you should always watch your units!\n",
    "\n",
    "**SI units** were first developed during the French Revolution, but have come to be a system used globally. They are convenient, since conversions between many units for the same type of quantity use a power of 10. Here is a table of the **base** units we will use this year. **Dimension** is the basic physical quantity that is being measured, while the **unit** is how the dimension is measured.\n",

    "| time             | second (s)        |\n",
    "| electric current | ampere (A)        |\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference between dimension and unit, notice that I can measure the same *dimension* in different *units* -- time can be measured in seconds, hours, or years. In addition, we will later built up other units from combinations of these basic units (for example, velocity is measured in meters per second).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, you have a good sense of what a second is, but maybe not the same intuition for a meter or a kilogram. My height is a little bit less than two meters; this is roughly the same as the distance from fingertip to fingertip when I fully stretch out my arms. A two liter bottle of soda has a mass of two kilograms. Notice that the base unit of mass is the *kilogram*, not the gram! The original definition started with the gram, but then it was decided to be too small of a unit, so they made the kilogram the base unit. Interestingly enough, the definitions of all the base SI units was recently changed, to make them more accurate as well as more accesible to scientists around the world; you can find out more at the [website](https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition) created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology."

The diameter would be a really *small* number, and the mass a very *large* one. To built up better units, we can glue a **prefix** onto the front of the basic unit. Some common prefixes are listed in the table below; this list -- with the power, prefix, and abbrevation, must be *memorized*!\n",

Often they try to \"think too much\" about it, and thus flip the sign of the exponent in the power of ten. Here's how you should think of this: *the prefix is the same as the power of ten*.

In other words, where the prefix is on one side is replaced by the number on the other. Also, note the \"one with the prefix\" is not always on the top or the bottom, it is where it needs to be to cancel out other units, or to give the desired unit at the end. The second part has microseconds in the bottom, to cancel the first one in the top; the third part has kiloseconds in the top, since that is what we want at the end!\n",

    "Is there a more efficient way of writing the carrier's mass than 87,996,900,000 grams?

You can also think of this as moving the decimal point. Every time you move the point to the left, you gain a power of ten, and to the right, you lose one.

    "This gives the standard scientific notation. However, there is an alternative format, known as **engineering notation**, that is useful for converting from numbers with base SI units into units with prefixes. The idea is to write the number as you would with ordinary scientific notation, but use only a multiple of three as the exponent for the power of ten. Thus, the number out front has to be something between 1 and 1000. For example, if I take the carrier's mass, then\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage to engineering notation is that you can now directly read off the proper prefix for the base units grams. Since $10^9$ is the prefix \"giga\" (G), then the carrier has a mass of 87.996 Gg. Just to be clear, though, when I say \"scientific notation\", I am still referring to the standard version! I will come back to this point later.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, you may still have a question about the ship's mass quoted above. Why do I need all of those numbers in $8.79969 \\times 10^{10}$ grams? It's pretty close to $9 \\times 10^{10}$ grams, so can't I use that? Well, what it means is that the US Navy has a very precise measurement of the mass of the carrier. This is reflected in the number of **significant figures** reported in their data. Physically, significant figures (or \"sig figs\") depend on how precisely you can measure a quantity. How many sig figs should you use for each of the rulers shown in the figure?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparing the accuracy of two different rulers](../img/FND_AY19_MP1_L03_Fig01-Two-different-rulers_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ruler on the left has widely spaced markings, so you could only measure a length to one digit (\"1\" or \"2\"). The one on the right has more markings, and therefore you can measure to two digits (\"1.1\" or \"1.2\"). Thus, the left ruler can give 1 sig fig, while the right ruler can give two. A greater number of significant figures means the number has been measured to a higher precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb to use to find the number of sig figs a number has is to think about whether the number had to be written, or whether it is acting as a \"placeholder\" such as zero often does. To spell this out, here are some guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All non-zero digits are significant: 3.1415 has 5 sig figs, while 3.1 has only 2.\n",
    "* Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 50009 has 5 sig figs, and 1.01 has 3.\n",
    "* Leading zeros (left of the first non-zero digits) are *not* significant: 0.0999 and 0.0102 both have 3 sig figs. These are only placeholders, meant to indicate that the \"1\" in the last number, for example, is in the hundreths place, not the tenths.\n",
    "* Trailing zeros when no decimal place is present are not *necessarily* significant: 330 may have 2 or 3 sig figs, while 590,100 has 4, 5, or 6.\n",
    "* They *are* significant if a decimal place is written: 330. has 3 sig figs, and 590,100. has 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter two points are why scientific notation is a good way of writing numbers, to be sure of the number of significant figures. I can write $5.9010 \\times 10^5$, and know the number has 5 sig figs -- I didn't have to write the last zero, so its inclusion means it is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem:** How many sig figs does the number 0.010200 have?\n",
    "\n",
    "One good guideline when doing numerical calculations is to keep the numbers in the intermediate steps to one *more* sig fig than you need for the actual answer, then you would round the number at the end. This typically gives you more accuracy from the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem:** All of the numbers below are given with 4 significant figures. What would they be to only 3?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. 1.432\n",
    "> 1. 17.09\n",
    "> 1. $5.267 \\times 10^{-7}$\n",
    "> 1. $9.996 \\times 10^4$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why is engineering notation not the best? Suppose I have a length of $3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ m; you can easily see in scientific notation that this number has two sig figs. However, if I convert it to engineering notation, then it becomes $300 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, or 300 $\\mu$m. How many sig figs does it have now? The answer is unclear, since we can't easily identify it as \"two\" like we did in the standard notation. This is why we will stick to the standard notation, but you should be aware of engineering notation, and its strengths and weaknesses."

    "This lesson has three major pieces. The first dealt with the SI system of units, and dealt with building up derived units with prefixes, and converting between two different units. Along the way, we also talked about scientific notation and significant digits. We will be using all of these concepts throughout the year, so you need to maintain a solid grasp of using them. Remember to periodically review this material when it gets fuzzy. The second part covered displacement, as well as average and instantaneous velocity. These concepts were defined, and various relationships between them laid out. This includes how to get displacement from a velocity vs. time graph, and velocity from a position vs. time graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final part covered the vPython package, using it to create a `sphere` object. A good reference for this package is at [vPython.org](http://vpython.org). We talked about the attributes of objects like this, and how they can be defined. Then, from the definition of average velocity, the Euler method enabled us to animate the sphere, so it moved at a constant velocity. This included the use of a `while` loop for updating the position of the sphere. Finally, the position and velocity components of the sphere were graphed using the `graph` and `gcurve` modules in vPython.\n",

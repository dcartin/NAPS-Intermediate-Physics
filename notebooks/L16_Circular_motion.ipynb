    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have only talked about situations with a constant acceleration. This gives rise to either motion along a line (such as a book sliding along a table) or at most, the parabolic motion we saw for projectiles. However, this does not exhaust all of the possibilities! We can consider cases where the direction of the acceleration changes, even if the magnitude does not. The prime example of this, and what we will look at in this lesson, is the case of *uniform circular motion*. This is motion that is \"uniform\" -- the *speed* is constant (although the *velocity* will not be!) -- and \"circular\" -- the object in question moves in a circular path around a fixed point.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure that you can think of many examples of uniform circular motion: a car driving around a circular track, a tetherball on its string as it circles the central pole, the Moon orbiting the Earth. In fact, the last case is an interesting historical story, since Newton used the Moon's orbit to figure out that gravitation was a universal force acting on all objects. The distance to the Moon, and the time it takes to make one orbit, had been known since the time of the ancient Greeks. Newton used these numbers to calculate the magnitude of the Moon's acceleration, and showed that it could be the result of a gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon if gravity acted in a particular way. We will explore this more when we get to gravitation in [Lesson 21](grav).\n",

    "## Circular motion\n",
    "\n",
    "As defined above, **uniform circular motion** is the motion of an object at constant speed in a circular path around a point. Notice that *velocity* is not constant, since the instantaneous direction of the object's motion at any point is changing; only the magnitude of the velocity is assumed to be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the examples of uniform circular motion listed in the first section above: a car driving around a circular track, a tetherball on its string as it circles the central pole, the Moon orbiting the Earth. Remember that Newton's first law says that an object will continue with constant velocity unless acted on by a net force. Since all of these have changing velocity, their circular motion must be due to a net force (from Newton's second law). What force or forces are causing this motion for each of the cases? It depends!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The force of *friction* keeps the car moving in a circle around the track. The easy way to see this is to think about what would happen on an icy track; which way would the car move then?\n",
    "1. The *gravitational* force is responsible for the Moon's circular orbit. In fact, as we will see in Lesson 25, it is actually that the Earth and the Moon are *both* orbiting around the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system! We don't notice this effect, because the Earth has about 81 times the Moon's mass.\n",
    "1. For the tetherball on its tether, we have to be careful about what is causing the circular motion. It is definitely related to the tether, but not the entire force. If you draw an FBD for the system, the vertical part of the tension force is opposing the force of gravity, so the tetherball does not fall down. Only the *horizontal component of the tension force* is acting to keep the tetherball in a (horizontal) circle.\n",

    "## Centripetal acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "If we imagine an object moving in a circle at constant speed, its acceleration is known as a **centripetal acceleration**, denoted by the symbol ${\\vec a}_{cp}$. This comes from the Latin for \"center-seeking\", and this is the direction of the centripetal acceleration: towards the center of the circle. Hopefully, you watched the video above of the bowling ball hit by a mallet, so the ball moves in a circle. When the ball is *not* hit, it moves in a straight line, as you would expect from Newton's first law. When it is hit, the ball moves in a circle with its center in the direction of the mallet's force. Later in this notebook, you will use a vPython simulation to see what happens when you choose different directions for the centripetal acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to that, however, let's find what the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is. Here is my favorite proof of this, which I originally found in a Khan Academy video (linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1_sO8QY3o)). As the object moves in a circle, its velocity vector will always be of constant size (since the speed remains the same) and tangential to the circle (perpendicular to the radius). This looks like the picture shown below, with a ball moving in a clockwise circle.\n",

    "However, not only is the position of the ball rotating around in a circle, so is the velocity vector! The velocity is always tangential to the circle, so as the position angle changes, so does the direction of the velocity. So we can make a \"velocity circle\" by taking all of these velocities and placing their tails at the same point. Then the tips of all these vectors forms a circle as well.

This means dragging the shape through a path, and the final shape includes all the points the original shape moved through.

The physics in the vPython program is at the very beginning and towards the end. In the definitions at the top, I define the radius `RING_RADIUS` of the desired circular motion of the ball. This is also the radius of the ring as well, so if the ball leaves the ring, there is a problem! I also give the initial velocity of the ball, which we will use later.

In other words, we are not introducting a new interaction, such as gravity, tension, or friction. Instead, we are collecting any and all forces that contribute to circular motion, and calling it the centripetal force. Note that some of the forces involved may actually \"fight\" this inward-pointing direction. For example, if you are riding a roller coaster at the bottom of a loop, the force of gravity points *away* from the loop's center; only the fact that the normal force is larger, and pointing towards the center of the loop, keeps you moving along the track in circular motion.\n",

    "This is a good time to consider an important type of force we will see often in upcoming lessons; the gravitational, spring, and electrostatic forces are all members of this category. To set this up, suppose there is a special point which we will call the point ${\\vec r} = {\\vec 0}$ (the \"origin\" or \"equilibrium point\"), while an object at another point ${\\vec r} \\ne {\\vec 0}$. Thus, the distance from the origin to the object is given as $r$. Usually, this special point is not some abstract point, but instead corresponds to something physical. For the gravitational and electrostatic forces, ${\\vec r} = {\\vec 0}$ may correspond with another mass or charge that is affecting the motion of the object in question. For the spring force, where a spring is attached to the object, ${\\vec r} = {\\vec 0}$ is the location where the spring is neither compressed nor stretched.\n",

This is because the direction is opposite to ${\\hat r}$, and ${\\hat r}$ points away from the origin. On the other hand, if $F(r) > 0$, then the central force ${\\vec F}_c$ is *repulsive*, away from the origin. Note that some central forces can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the objects involved! The best example is the electrostatic force, depending on whether the charges are the same sign (e.g. both positive) or different signs (positive and negative).

    "So what is going on here with the ball's motion? We can divide the velocity of the ball into two components: the **radial** velocity component $v_r$, which is along the direction towards the origin, and the **perpendicular** velocity component $v_\\perp$, which is perpendicular to ${\\vec r}$. Remember that, as the ball moves around the origin, the direction of the position vector ${\\vec r}$ will change, and thus, so will what we mean by the $v_r$ and $v_\\perp$ components. Now, everything we did above with centripetal acceleration dealt only with a constant speed $v$.

This results in the ball veering away from the center of the circle. The radius is getting larger, and the radial velocity component $v_r$ is getting smaller, as the ball slows down. On the other hand, when $a_{n + 1} > v^2 / r$, the angle between ${\\vec v}_n$ and ${\\vec v}_{n + 1}$ is bigger than when the ball was in uniform circular motion.

    "To see this in practice, look back at the graph accompanying the motion simulation. The blue line gives the object's position $r$ away from the origin as a function of time. As you saw when you ran the program above, the ball moves away from, then closer to, the center, over and over. This gives the cyclic motion you see in the blue line. Remember that this is *only* the radial motion; the ball also has a non-zero perpendicular velocity component $v_\\perp$ throughout its orbit, so it does not fall through the origin. The red line is more complicated -- what it shows is the difference between the magnitude $F_c$ of the central force, and the magnitude $mv^2 /r$ of the centripetal force. In other words, it shows whether the acceleration magnitude $a$ is larger or smaller than than the value $v^2/r$ required to move in a circle with constant radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said above, when $F_c < mv^2 / r$, the ball veers away from the center. So, in the graph, notice that when $F_c - mv^2 / r < 0$, the ball's motion towards the center slows down, then reverses to move away from the center. Remember that force changes velocity, not position, so there is not an instant change in radial motion when $F_c - mv^2 / r < 0$! On the flip side, when $F_c - mv^2 / r > 0$, then the ball's motion will start curving towards the center of the circle. So the radial component $v_r$ of the ball, originally pointing outward, will decrease in size, then start pointing towards the origin.\n",

    "Here is a helpful analogy. Suppose you are driving a car, and trying to make a tight turn. If the frictional force is large enough between the tires and the road, you can do this, and the car makes the required path of small radius. However, if your tires slip, or the road is icy, then you can’t make the turn, and your car will slip outward to a turn with a larger radius. This is what is happening every time the ball starts moving towards the center, due to the central force. The constant force ${\\vec F}_c$ is insufficient to keep the ball in a tight circle, so the ball \"slips\" outward. Eventually, the radius is so large that the central force can start pulling the ball towards the origin, even as the ball continues to orbit this point.\n",

    "There are many situations where objects move in a circle, from a car driving around a turn, to the planets orbiting the Sun. This is due to an acceleration that has a constant magnitude, but a continually changing direction. We will build on these ideas in future lessons. The obvious case, mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, is the orbits of objects in space, due to the gravitational force (covered in [Lesson 22](grav)). Another occurrence is looking at the motion of a mass on a spring, if the mass is \"orbiting\" as well, moving in an elliptical path. Both of these examples have a lot of similarities in their motion, and hopefully we will get a chance to discuss this a little.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also started talking about central forces. We will see this idea several times again in the remainder of the course; some examples are gravitation, the spring force, and the electrostatic force. Central forces use many of the ideas we talk about in these lessons, so it will be a frequent example. In this lesson, we already saw how to define a central force in terms of an object's position vector, and possible types of motion the object can have. This motion is described not only in terms of the tangential velocity component, but also its radial velocity component (towards or away from the center). Although we didn't talk about it here, the tangential speed $v_t$ actually changed as the ball moved in its orbit, an example of *non-uniform circular motion*. In this case, there is the centripetal acceleration talked about in this lesson, pointing towards the center of the circle, as well as a tangential acceleration pointing either in the same direction, or the opposite direction, to the motion. This might happen if you use the gas or brakes as you drive a car around a turn. We will revisit this when we talk about angular momentum in [Lesson 18](ang-mom).\n",

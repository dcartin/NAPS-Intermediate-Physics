    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This year in intermediate physics, you will learn the Python programming language along with many important physics concepts. Python was invented in 1990 by Guido van Rossem, a Dutch computer scientist. Python is a modern, object-oriented language which is easy to learn. All of the instructions you give the computer will be in the Python programming language. These instructions are collectively called **code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Physics uses tools from many other different areas -- writing, mathematics, and more recently, computer programming. Nowadays, any working scientist, mathematician, or engineer should know at least the basics of writing a computer program.\n",
    "* In Python, we can create simulations that illustrate what is happening in physical situations. This helps to understand aspects of physics that are difficult to see using other methods.\n",
    "* Both physics and computer programming involve thinking logically about a problem, and solving it in a methodical way. In particular, you must understand the physics concepts yourself before you can explain it clearly and precisely to a computer!\n",
    "* An important skill in programming is learning how to *debug* a program -- figuring out where in the program code a mistake has been made, and fixing it. Sometimes this can take a while! A similar skill is very useful in finding the error in a physics problem solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is very common language that is relatively easy to learn, but has lots of add-ons for powerful applications.\n",
    "* There are several physics classes across the country that use Python programs in their class.\n",
    "* We will often use the vPython package, which allows us to easily create 3D visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of the academic year, we will use files such as these, called Jupyter \"notebooks\", where we can combine explanation like a textbook along with the ability to run Python code. This notebook goes through some of the basic concepts and Python commands we will need to study the motion of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read through this lesson, you should keep in mind the specific objectives I hope you achieve. Every lesson will have such a list, and these lists also appear in the course syllabus. You should read through the objectives carefully first thing -- don't skip it! Below is your checklist for this lesson, the things you should get out of your reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Print the value of a numerical variable or a string to the screen using the `print` statement.\n",
    "* Create a Python program within a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "* Define a variable, and state the rules for Python variable names.\n",
    "* Add a comment to a program.\n",
    "* Update the value of a numerical variable.\n",
    "* Use the mathematical operators `+, -, *, /, %` to calculate the new value of a variable.\n",
    "* Use an `if` statement to check whether a logical condition is true.\n",
    "* Use a `while` loop to implement statements until a logical condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't feel you can do these things, you should work at it -- did you miss an important definition? Try the problems? Maybe playing around with the code cells more, and thinking of different scenarios will help."

    "For those learning a new programming language, it is traditional to first learn how to print the statement \"Hello world!\" This is known as a **string**, as opposed to an **integer** such as 5 or a floating point number (or **float**) such as 3.141592654. Together, these are known as **data types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now try this out. Whenever you see a gray rectangle (a **code cell**), such as the one below, you can run Python code, and then see the output. Usually, the code is already there and ready to be run. However, to see this process in action, first select the cell below with your mouse; a green outline should appear around the cell.

What gives you natural looking simulations, and what gives you \"bad physics\"? *You will learn best by trying*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many times we need to store numerical values for use later on in the program, and change these values as the program progresses (e.g. think about the position of a moving object). This is done in programming languages by creating a **variable** and setting it equal to the value desired.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The variable name must start with either a letter or the underscore (`_`) character.\n",
    "* Variable names cannot start with a number.\n",

    "* Variable names can only use letters, numbers, and the underscore.\n",

    "Although we will not see it immediately, I also use the convention that constants are given names in all capital letters. These will indicate variables that should not be changed anywhere in the code. So, if I want to define the total time a simulation will run, I may call it `MAX_TIME`. On the other hand, the current time could be another variable, such as `t`, which does change. I also tend to put the definitions of all the variables at the top of the program, so I can find them easily if I need to alter their values.\n",

To do this, instead of using the 'ordinary' division symbol `/`, we use the 'floor' division symbol `//`. This latter symbol finds how many times the divisor goes into the original number, discarding the remainder. For example, `17 // 5 = 3`, since $17 = 5 \\times 3 + 2$.\n",

    "This lesson covers a lot of the Python ideas and commands we will use all year. In particular, it covers variables, mathematical operations, `while` and `if` statements, and logical tests. You should review this lesson every once in a while, to make sure you haven't forgotten anything, or if you need a reminder of how a particular command works. Note that this is a rather simplified version of Python -- there are many other commands that we will not use in this class. However, it does give you a basic familiarity with the language. If you are interested in learning more, there are *many* resources on-line, since Python is a very popular language. Two particular sites I find nice are [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) and [Easy Python Docs](http://easypythondocs.com/); just realize they feature the *entire* language!\n",

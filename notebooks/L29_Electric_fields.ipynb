    "The physicist of today is well versed in the use of Newton's second law and forces acting on an object. However, these methods are restricted to physical objects (balls rolling down ramps), and do not map over to other situations. In fact, it is much easier to deal with electricity and magnetism when using a more general idea, known as a *field*. It was this conceptual leap in the mid-19th century that eventually set the stage for the quantum mechanical revolution of the early 20th century. Thus, the fundamental theories of physics are written as quantum field theories (and not \"force theories\"!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a field was developed by two great scientists -- the experimentalist Michael Faraday, and the theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Faraday, a self-taught physicist, was the first to lay out a vision of electric and magnetic phenomena arising from ''lines of force'' -- physical tubes forming space and affecting the motion of charged particles moving through space. This was more of a philosophical viewpoint on experimental results, rather than a systematic mathematical picture. Then, Maxwell developed a more mathematical framework, writing down what are now known as Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields. These equations were the inspiration for much of modern physics, including Einstein's theory of special relativity, and the quantum field theories used to explain interactions at the subatomic scale.\n",

    "Throughout this lesson, we will use the gravitational field ${\\vec g}$ as a stepping stone to understanding the electric field ${\\vec E}$. It may help to go back to Lesson 25 (universal gravitation) where we talked about ${\\vec g}$ in some detail. Remember that the gravitational field is defined as\n",

    "$$\n",

    "where $m$ is the *test mass* used to measure the gravitational field at its location. The idea is to \"factor out\" the size of the test mass, so that we are only measuring the gravitational effects of all the other masses around the test mass' location. Note that the gravitational *force* ${\\vec F}_g$ and the gravitational *field* ${\\vec g}$ always point in the same direction, since the mass $m > 0$ for all objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now define the **electric field** in the same way, by analogy -- using a **test charge** $q$ instead of mass $m$, and electrostatic force ${\\vec F}_e$ instead of gravitational force ${\\vec F}_g$.\n",

    "It helps to think conceptually about what we are doing: we want to find a quantity ${\\vec E}$ that gives the influence of a collection of charges at a particular point $P$, so we place a test charge $q$ at this point $P$. However, we want our answer ${\\vec E}$ not to depend on what test charge we use, so we \"factor out\" the size of the charge $q$ from the electrostatic force. Thus, if you use a large, positive test charge, and I use a small, negative test charge, the electrostatic forces on our charges will be different, but the electric field ${\\vec E}$ we measure will be exactly the *same*!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the direction of the electric field first. We can use the definition of the electric field to find the direction of the electric field, due to a single charge. In particular, suppose there is a charge $Q > 0$ creating an electric field we want to measure. You use your positive test charge $q_+$ to find the electrostatic force on your charge, as seen in the picture below. Since both charges are positive, the test charge is repelled from the charge $Q$. Then you divide the electrostatic force on $q_+$ by the charge $q_+$ (using the definition of electric field above) to get the electric field at the point you placed the test charge. Because $q_+ > 0$, the electrstatic force ${\\vec F}_e$ and the electric field ${\\vec E}$ point in the same direction -- away from $Q$.\n",

    "After you do that, I decide to check your answer by using my negative test charge $q_-$. Again, I find the electrostatic force on $q_-$ due to $Q$, and then divide out by $q_-$ to get ${\\vec E}$. Since $q_- < 0$, the two charges now attract, but dividing the force vector by a negative number gives an electric field that points in the opposite direction. But this is the same direction that you found with your positive test charge! Everyone agrees on the size and direction of the electric field, regardless of what test charge they use to measure it.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The electric field created by a positive charge points *away* from that charge.\n",
    "* The electric field created by a negative charge points *towards* from that charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rule of thumb for electric field direction:** Since the electric field always points in the same direction as the electrostatic force on a positive test charge, you can just ask yourself which way the force is on a positive test charge placed at the point of interest, in order to get the direction of the electric field at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the next cell, you can play around with the electric fields due to collections of positive and negative charges. The PhET app will show you the total electric field vectors at a grid of points. This ${\\vec E}_{net}$ is the vector sum of all the individual electric fields, so its direction can change depending on the size and sign of the individual charges creating the net field."

We will find the field a distance $d$ away from charge $Q$ by placing a test charge $q$ there, at a point I will call $P$, and find the electrostatic force on it.

    "A very helpful way of showing the strength and direction of the electric field in a region of space is by drawing the **field lines**. These are a pictorial representation of the electric field, much like a contour map shows the altitude of a surface. Using electric field lines is helpful is gauging both the direction of the field, as well as the relative strength of the field, at various locations. To start, it may be helpful to think of this first in terms of the gravitational field, something we are more familiar with, so I will use this as an example to build up to electric field lines.\n",

    "As we all learned in the cradle, the gravitational field near the surface of the Earth is 9.81 m/s$^2$ pointing downward (there are actually small variations, but we will ignore those). What this means is that if I throw a test mass into the air anywhere on the Earth's surface, then ignoring air resistance, the acceleration of that mass will be downward. If I have a bunch of such test masses, and I look at the gravitational field on each of them, it would look like the picture below.\n",

Instead, they give the direction of the gravitational field, which in turn tells you about the acceleration of the object. You can see that by running the two cells below. The cyan arrows represent the constant gravitational field lines near the ground. On the ball itself, the magenta arrow shows the ball's velocity, and the white arrow its acceleration. The white arrow will always match the field at that location, but the trajectory of the ball is not straight down because of its non-zero $v_x$ component."

    "As stated in the introduction of this lesson, the concept of fields is the basis of much of modern physics. We had previously seen the gravitational field. The \"9.81 m/s$^2$\" you have memorized is just the magnitude of the Earth's gravitational field near its surface; however, such fields are present everywhere in the Universe. Now we have a similar idea for the electric field. Because most things do not have a net charge, electric fields are not as ubiquitous as the gravitational variety. But they do play a background role in how electric circuits are able to convey charges around and do useful work. The next few lessons now turn to the ideas of circuitry.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* State the direction of the electric field due to a point charge.\n",
    "* Calculate the electric field at a specified point due to a collection of charges.\n",
    "* Interpret the electric field lines of a given situation."

    "Over the past few lessons, you have seen how vectors are important when studying the motion of an object. The fundamental properties of motion -- position, velocity, and acceleration -- are all vectors. Thus, both their definitions, and the mathematical relationships between them, are vector equations. Even with the scalar kinematic equations, the vectors components of these quantities are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, up to this point, we have only worked with components of vectors. Suppose instead, you are given the size and direction of a vector? An example would be saying the speed of a ship is 15.0 knots, and it is moving 30.0$^\\circ$ north of west. How can we write this in terms of components? Or, if we go the other way around, if I know the components of an acceleration, how can I find the magnitude and direction of this vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the purpose of this lesson -- to learn how to go back and forth between writing a vector in terms of components, and using magnitude and direction to describe the vector. This will use the mathematics of trigonometry heavily, so it is important you get a good grasp on how this process works. After this lesson, you should have all the basic relations needed to go from one description of a vector to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to remember is the components of a vector are the sizes of the vector along *perpendicular* directions (recall the streets and avenues of Manhattan). This is why we use *right triangle* trigonometry, because the components are always going to be perpendicular. (You can be brave and use the law of cosines or sines if you know them, but you will quickly get bogged down by the time you try to add three vectors!)\n",

    "* Given the components of a 2D vector, find its magnitude and direction.\n",

    "\n",
    "We saw earlier how to take a vector in vPython, and find its magnitude. Let's now reverse the process, and start from a magnitude and direction, then find the corresponding vPython vector. To do this, we need to import the trigonometric functions in vPython; these are the modules **sin** and **cos**. However, vPython does not use degrees as a unit of angle; instead, it uses *radians*. If you have never seen these before, it is an alternate (and probably more sensible!) angular unit, with one complete turn around the circumference defined as $2 \\pi$ radians. This means the conversion factor between degrees and radians is\n",

If you go back to the 'Trig Tour' application given in a cell above, you can change the angle measurement back and forth between degrees and radians, and see what the relationship is for the unit circle, and all of the trig functions.\n",

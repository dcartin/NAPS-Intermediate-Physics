    "There are many times where a mathematical object allows us to greatly simplify a calculation, where it would be tedious otherwise. Hopefully, you have seen that this is true with vectors -- they nicely codify many physical properties in three dimensions, and summarize this information in one equation (rather than three!). So, as we have recently seen, all the possible situations in relation motion are condensed into two vector equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar idea motivates the definition of the \"scalar product\". A major use of the scalar product for us will be identifying the angle between two vectors, and specifically when they are parallel or perpendicular. The scalar product will be used several times in the rest of the course. In Lesson 12, we will use it when simulating 2D collisions in vPython. In Lesson 14, it helps define unit vectors for describing motion along a ramp, or perpendicular to it. In Lesson 21, the notion of \"work\" -- defined as a scalar product between force and displacement -- will be our gateway into the powerful methods of energy conservation.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are defining it now so that we can use what we have covered in the previous few lessons to deal with two-dimensional collisions. To motivate this, let's consider an example we looked at before. Suppose we have a ball bouncing against a wall, where the wall is along the $x$ axis; this is shown in the figure above, taken from Lesson 08. We found there what is hopefully intuitive: the force of the wall does nothing to the $x$ component of the ball's velocity, but reverses the direction of the $y$ component, keeping its size the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the same thing would happen if the wall were replaced by another ball! So this is a special example of a 2D collision. Now the question arises, what if the wall were *not* along the $x$ axis, but at some arbitrary angle? How do we \"reverse the direction\" of only one of the ball's velocity components? This is what would occur in a general 2D collision. You could work out the new velocity for any orientation of the wall, but it would be a trigonometric hassle. Instead, in Lesson 12, we will use the scalar product to find the perpendicular piece of the incoming velocity. So, let's now define the scalar product, and see it in action.\n",

    "### A new mathematical concept\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen in physics class, there are several times where mathematical tools are necessary to properly explain and understand physics concepts. For example, so far, you have seen trigonometry and vectors. These have helped us describe the motion of projectiles, see what happens when objects collide, and understand how moving objects appear to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on vectors, up to this point, you have seen how to add and subtract vectors (*vector addition*) and to make them bigger or smaller in size (*scalar multiplication*), possibly flipping their direction 180$^\\circ$ at the same time. Is there anything else we can do with vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that, given two vectors, there are two other mathematical operations we will see in this course. The first is called the **scalar product** (although often I will say \"dot product\", because of the symbol used!), which takes two vectors ${\\vec A}, {\\vec B}$ and outputs a scalar ${\\vec A} \\cdot {\\vec B}$.\n",

    "The scalar product gives you a *scalar*, not a vector!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all math ideas we use in this course, the scalar product is helpful in summing up an important physical idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The scalar product ${\\vec A} \\cdot {\\vec B}$ depends on the size $A$ and $B$ of the two vectors, and the angle $\\theta$ between them.\n",

    "* given a vector ${\\vec V}$ and vector equation, find the components of that equation parallel to ${\\vec V}$ (we have already done this secretly!)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see at different points that this gives you important information about the physics in a particular situation. In the next lesson after this one, we will use the scalar product to find the motion of a block along a ramp (or *inclined plane*) by separating the forces that are parallel and perpendicular to the incline. Later on, you will see the scalar product when we find the *work* done on an object by a force; this will be the first step in finding the mechanical energy of the object as it moves along.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "There is a second operation, we will see the **vector product** (or \"cross product\", again from the sign used to denote the operation), which takes two vectors and outputs a third vector that is perpendicular to the first two."

    "### Definition of scalar product\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to define what the scalar product does to the two vectors involved is to see what it does to the unit vectors ${\\hat x}, {\\hat y},$ and ${\\hat z}$ that point along each of the three axes. Remember that any vector in three-dimensional space can be written as the *vector* sum of scalar multiples of these vectors. It will be easy to see this, since the scalar product is defined so that it \"strips off\" the components of the vector. For example, if you have an arbitrary vector ${\\vec A}$, then it can be written as the vector sum\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec A} = A_x {\\hat x} + A_y {\\hat y} + A_z {\\hat z}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A_x, A_y,$ and $A_z$ are its three components. If we take the scalar product of this vector with the unit vector ${\\hat x}$, say, then the resulting scalar is just the $x$ component of the vector!\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    A_x = {\\vec A} \\cdot {\\hat x} = {\\hat x} \\cdot {\\vec A}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The same would hold true for the other two components -- the scalar product ${\\vec A} \\cdot {\\hat y}$ would give the $y$ component $A_y$, for example. Note that it does not matter in which order you write the vectors; this is important to remember, since when we get to the vector product later in the class, this will not be true!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what definition is necessary in order for this to happen? Again, the idea is that the scalar product with a unit vector is \"stripping off\" the piece of the other vector in that direction. In other words, only the part of the vector ${\\vec A}$ that is *parallel* to the unit vector remains. A little bit of thought leads to the following definition:\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\hat x} \\cdot {\\hat x} = {\\hat y} \\cdot {\\hat y} = {\\hat z} \\cdot {\\hat z} = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "The unit vectors ${\\hat x}, {\\hat y}$ and ${\\hat z}$ are all perpendicular to each other -- each of the three has no component along the other two -- so that\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\hat x} \\cdot {\\hat y} = {\\hat x} \\cdot {\\hat z} = {\\hat y} \\cdot {\\hat z} = 0\n",

    "### Isn't this just \"vector multiplication\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "One question I get asked a lot is whether this is all just \"multiplying\" vectors. To answer that, let's think about what multiplication means. Here are two perspectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simplest way to understand multiplication is to combine groups of objects. If I have two baskets, and each basket has three oranges in it, then I have $(2)(3) = 6$ oranges total. In other words, the total number of oranges is twice as big as the amount in each basket.\n",
    "* Another way of thinking about multiplication is as the inverse of division. To say that $(2)(3) = 6$ means that I can divide 6 into two groups of three ($6 / 2 = 3$), or I can also divide it into three groups of two ($6 / 3 = 2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we return to vectors. First, when I think of \"making a vector bigger\", what am I saying? If I have a vector ${\\vec V}$, and make it twice as big, I can imagine this means making the magnitude $V$ twice as big. But this is the idea behind *scalar multiplication*, where we multiply each component of the vector by the same scalar. I could also imagine that I \"make the angle bigger\", but that quickly leads to weird thinking -- if an acceleration vector has a magnitude of 3.00 m/s$^2$ at 40.0$^\\circ$ west of south, and I triple it, is the new vector now at 120$^\\circ$ west of south? What does that mean? (It might help to try and draw a picture, to see that this description of an angle is not useful!)\n",
    "\n",
    "If I turn to division, what does it mean to divide a vector by another? If I wanted to \"divide\" the vector ${\\vec A}$ by the vector ${\\vec B}$, I could guess that I divide the components of ${\\vec A}$ by those of ${\\vec B}$. But what if one of the components of ${\\vec A}$ is zero? Or of ${\\vec B}$? Do I get a unique answer for this division, or are there multiple possibilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the scalar product defined here is different than ordinary multiplication of numbers. We have seen that there are vectors whose scalar product is zero -- those vectors must be perpendicular to each other. But we can't imagine \"undoing\" the scalar product (as division \"undoes\" multiplication) in a case like that. It is not helpful to think of the scalar product as \"multiplying vectors\", it is something different!"

We will use this next when we consider 2D collisions in Lesson 12.\n",

    "Now that you have velocity under the belt, it is time to move on to acceleration. On the one hand, acceleration is more abstract than velocity. This is because acceleration is defined in terms of the change in velocity with time, while velocity is the change in position over time. So acceleration is the change in the change in the position over a time interval. As you will see when you program an accelerating object into vPython, if you are not careful with all those changes, you will get incorrect motion! Related to this is some confusion about the relation between velocity and acceleration. Sometimes there is a notion that \"greater speed = greater acceleration\", which is not true. We will examine the relationship between velocity and acceleration in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, you are very familiar with the perfect example of acceleration we see everyday: the acceleration of a falling object. Our brains are wired to understand what happens when we drop a tennis ball, for example, for a small time vs. a large one. We know that if we want to catch a ball that has fallen for twice the time, we don't put our hand twice as low as we would for the short time, but roughly three times lower. The ball does not display the motion of something in constant velocity, but of an object with velocity changing at a constant rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of acceleration will tie all of this together. The plan is to define acceleration, and explore some of its aspects, then try to use this concept to model the motion of a ball moving vertically under the influence *only* of the gravitational force. This type of motion is known as **free fall**.\n",

If you go back to Cromer's original paper on the method, he says that the method was discovered by a student accidently reversing the two lines! However, looking at the right-hand graph in the figure above, you see there is still a problem -- now there are \"extra triangles\", and the area is too big. This means that we are using too large of a velocity, and the dropped ball is further along the path than it should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final method is to take how we defined velocity seriously. Remember that the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec v}_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta {\\vec r}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "says to use the *average* velocity when finding the change in position $\\Delta {\\vec r}$. For an object moving with constant acceleration -- and thus with velocity changing at a constant rate -- the average velocity is simply\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec v}_{avg} = \\frac{1}{2} ({\\vec v}_i + {\\vec v}_f)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For our case, this means that we update the position using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    r_{n + 1, y} = r_{n, y} + \\frac{1}{2} (v_{n, y} + v_{n + 1, y}) \\Delta t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the middle graph in the figure above, you'll see that this is the \"Goldilocks\" solution. Although there are both missing and extra triangles on either side of the velocity vs. time curve, they cancel out, giving us the correct answer for the change in position $\\Delta r_{n, y}$ from $r_{n, y}$ to $r_{n + 1, y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this into programming code, it means that we have to save the old value $v_{n, y}$ of the velocity before we update it. If you think about it, there is no other way to order the two lines of code. Thus, the vPython implementation would be something like\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    ball.oldvel = vector(ball.velocity)\n",
    "    ball.velocity = ball.velocity + ball.accel * DT\n",
    "    ball.pos = ball.pos + 0.5 * (ball.oldvel + ball.velocity) * DT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think the way to store the old velocity in the variable `ball.oldvel` is a little weird, and you'd be right! It turns out this is an idiosyncrasy of the vPython module. If you ever get more into programming, you will find that every programming language has its own little things that don't quite make sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one way to make *any* of these methods work better is to decrease the size of the time step. If the rectangles are not as wide, the missing triangles become smaller as well, and the answer gets closer to the right one. This is essentially what is going on when we find the instantaneous velocity or acceleration -- by making $\\Delta t \\to 0$, we \"find the slope\" at a single time, rather than the average over a finite length of time. In terms of computation, reducing the time step `DT` makes the calculations more accurate, but also increases the number of such steps that must be done. There is a lot of effort in computational physics to find smarter ways of increasing the accuracy of simulations without slowing them down greatly. We will see some other methods of how this is done in future lessons."

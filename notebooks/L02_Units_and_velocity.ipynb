    "In this lesson, you will start with a basic definition of a physical quantity -- namely, velocity -- as well as the units of measurement used to quantify these. While you do this, you will also learn about the vPython package, and create moving objects in vPython. Often in a programming language, the command of the language must be supplemented to make more features available. The 3D graphics package vPython for the Python programming language was created by David Scherer while he was a student at Carnegie Mellon University. vPython allows you to create and animate 3D objects, and to navigate around in a 3D scene by spinning and zooming, using the mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need vPython? Why can't we just use the formulas and calculate things with them? My experience as a teacher is that many times, students see mathematical equations as a fancy machine that you put numbers into, then you get other numbers out of. What do they mean? Well, my roommate (or a supplemental instructor, or somebody in my platoon) told me to do it this way, and...\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal with using vPython is that you *understand* physics a little better than you did when started the class. In particular for this lesson, I notice that a frequent confusion is when to use the basic equation you will study here, namely the average velocity,\n",

So, my hope is that, by programming this equation into the computer, over the course of this lesson and the next (Lesson 03 -- acceleration), you will get a better grasp of what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How to read these lessons:** This is the first lesson where we start dealing with calculations of physical quantities. I emphasized at the beginning of Lesson 01 that these lessons are meant to be interactive, and it is the same here: *do not read these notes like a novel*. What I mean by that is\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * You should have a pencil, paper, and a calculator by your side before you even start reading the lesson.\n",
    "> * As you go through, try the problems listed, and check to see if you can do them. If not, come to class with a question about your confusion.\n",
    "> * Don't skip parts just because you don't understand them! Make a decent effort to carefully read the text, and try the problems. Note this does *not* mean to get bogged down. If you devote a good deal of time, and it still does not make sense, come and ask me, either in class or EI. But at least give it the ol' college try.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> I will confess that I often don't follow my own advice, and I frequently come to regret it. I can get away with it when reading about material I already understand fairly well, but when I am trying to learn something new, I usually crash and burn because I have not been methodically working through the concepts. Then I have to start over, and read it again. And again. And again. If learning was easy, everybody would do it.\n",

    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* List the basic SI units for distance, mass and time.\n",
    "* List all prefixes to be used in intermediate physics, along with the power of ten associated with them.\n",
    "* Convert between a base unit and a unit of the same type with a prefix, or units of the same type with different prefixes.\n",
    "* Convert between a number in decimal form and one in scientific notation.\n",
    "* Convert between non-SI units and the appropriate SI unit.\n",
    "* State the definitions of average and instantaneous velocity.\n",
    "* Describe how the graphs of position vs. time and velocity vs. time for an object are related.\n",

    "Sometimes it is the most ordinary things that can be important. One of these are the **units** you will use to explain what a given number means. If I tell you the distance is \"5\", what does that mean: 5 centimeters? 5 kilometers? 5 light-years? Those are very different measures of a length -- the first would be the life's journey of a tiny bacteria, the second a nice run in the morning, and the last is roughly the distance from the Sun to the nearest star system.\n",

    "In 1999 the Mars Climate Orbiter is believed to have either disintegrated in Mars' atmosphere, or bounced off into deep space, due to improper software code. One of the craft's programs output impulse measurements in \"ft lbs\" instead of the SI standard \"N s\". Physics teachers around the country are grateful that NASA spent $327 million for this shining example of why you should always watch your units!\n",
    "\n",
    "**SI units** were first developed during the French Revolution, but have come to be a system used globally. They are convenient, since conversions between many units for the same type of quantity use a power of 10. Here is a table of the **base** units we will use this year. **Dimension** is the basic physical quantity that is being measured, while the **unit** is how the dimension is measured.\n",

    "To understand the difference between dimension and unit, notice that I can measure the same *dimension* in different *units* -- time can be measured in seconds, hours, or years. In addition, we will later built up other units from combinations of these basic units (for example, velocity is measured in meters per second).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, you have a good sense of what a second is, but maybe not the same intuition for a meter or a kilogram. My height is a little bit less than two meters; this is roughly the same as the distance from fingertip to fingertip when I fully stretch out my arms. A two liter bottle of soda has a mass of two kilograms. Notice that the base unit of mass is the *kilogram*, not the gram! The original definition started with the gram, but then it was decided to be too small of a unit, so they made the kilogram the base unit. Interestingly enough, the definitions of all the base SI units was recently changed, to make them more accurate as well as more accesible to scientists around the world; you can find out more at the [website](https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition) created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology."

    "However, these units are not always so useful. For example, what is the typical diameter of an atom? What is the mass of a new Ford-class aircraft carrier? The diameter would be a really *small* number, and the mass a very *large* one. To built up better units, we can glue a **prefix** onto the front of the basic unit. Some common prefixes are listed in the table below; this list -- with the power, prefix, and abbrevation, must be *memorized*!\n",

    "> **Important:** The one error I see students make over and over is to use the prefix table above incorrectly. Often they try to \"think too much\" about it, and thus flip the sign of the exponent in the power of ten. Here's how you should think of this: *the prefix is the same as the power of ten*. In other words, you can replace one with the other, and not change anything. Thus, for example,\n",

In other words, where the prefix is on one side is replaced by the number on the other. Also, note the \"one with the prefix\" is not always on the top or the bottom, it is where it needs to be to cancel out other units, or to give the desired unit at the end. The second part has microseconds in the bottom, to cancel the first one in the top; the third part has kiloseconds in the top, since that is what we want at the end!\n",

    "Is there a more efficient way of writing the carrier's mass than 87,996,900,000 grams? That's where **scientific notation** comes into play. **Proper scientific notation** writes a number in the form $a \\times 10^b$, where $a$ is a number between 1 and 10, and it is multiplied by the appropriate power of ten, or $10^b$. You can also think of this as moving the decimal point. Every time you move the point to the left, you gain a power of ten, and to the right, you lose one. Thus, the mass of the carrier would be $8.79969 \\times 10^{10}$ grams.

    "This gives the standard scientific notation. However, there is an alternative format, known as **engineering notation**, that is useful for converting from numbers with base SI units into units with prefixes. The idea is to write the number as you would with ordinary scientific notation, but use only a multiple of three as the exponent for the power of ten.

I will come back to this point later.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, you may still have a question about the ship's mass quoted above. Why do I need all of those numbers in $8.79969 \\times 10^{10}$ grams? It's pretty close to $9 \\times 10^{10}$ grams, so can't I use that? Well, what it means is that the US Navy has a very precise measurement of the mass of the carrier. This is reflected in the number of **significant figures** reported in their data. Physically, significant figures (or \"sig figs\") depend on how precisely you can measure a quantity. How many sig figs should you use for each of the rulers shown in the figure?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparing the accuracy of two different rulers](../img/FND_AY19_MP1_L03_Fig01-Two-different-rulers_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ruler on the left has widely spaced markings, so you could only measure a length to one digit (\"1\" or \"2\"). The one on the right has more markings, and therefore you can measure to two digits (\"1.1\" or \"1.2\"). Thus, the left ruler can give 1 sig fig, while the right ruler can give two. A greater number of significant figures means the number has been measured to a higher precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb to use to find the number of sig figs a number has is to think about whether the number had to be written, or whether it is acting as a \"placeholder\" such as zero often does. To spell this out, here are some guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All non-zero digits are significant: 3.1415 has 5 sig figs, while 3.1 has only 2.\n",
    "* Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 50009 has 5 sig figs, and 1.01 has 3.\n",
    "* Leading zeros (left of the first non-zero digits) are *not* significant: 0.0999 and 0.0102 both have 3 sig figs. These are only placeholders, meant to indicate that the \"1\" in the last number, for example, is in the hundreths place, not the tenths.\n",
    "* Trailing zeros when no decimal place is present are not *necessarily* significant: 330 may have 2 or 3 sig figs, while 590,100 has 4, 5, or 6.\n",
    "* They *are* significant if a decimal place is written: 330. has 3 sig figs, and 590,100. has 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter two points are why scientific notation is a good way of writing numbers, to be sure of the number of significant figures. I can write $5.9010 \\times 10^5$, and know the number has 5 sig figs -- I didn't have to write the last zero, so its inclusion means it is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem:** How many sig figs does the number 0.010200 have?\n",
    "\n",
    "One good guideline when doing numerical calculations is to keep the numbers in the intermediate steps to one *more* sig fig than you need for the actual answer, then you would round the number at the end. This typically gives you more accuracy from the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem:** All of the numbers below are given with 4 significant figures. What would they be to only 3?\n",

    "> 1. $5.267 \\times 10^{-7}$\n",
    "> 1. $9.996 \\times 10^4$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why is engineering notation not the best? Suppose I have a length of $3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ m; you can easily see in scientific notation that this number has two sig figs. However, if I convert it to engineering notation, then it becomes $300 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, or 300 $\\mu$m. How many sig figs does it have now? The answer is unclear, since we can't easily identify it as \"two\" like we did in the standard notation. This is why we will stick to the standard notation, but you should be aware of engineering notation, and its strengths and weaknesses."

    "Now we start studying the idea of \"velocity\". You probably have an intuition of what this means, but this is one topic where the common ideas of what \"velocity\" and \"speed\" mean are not good enough for use in physics. Thus, it is really important to be aware of what the definitions of these quantities are, and how they differ from what we use in everyday speech. To set this up, first we need some other definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in physics, we will use the difference between two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the difference in vertical position between the top and bottom of Ripley Hall?\n",
    "* What is the change in energy of a falling rock?\n",
    "* What is the voltage difference for an electron passing through a battery?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "To indicate a difference in the initial and final values of a quantity, we use the Greek letter capital delta $\\Delta$. This is always the final minus the initial values of the quantity. Thus, the difference in vertical position between the top and bottom of Ripley Hall is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\Delta r_y = r_{f, y} - r_{i, y}\n",

    "and the voltage difference for an electron passing through a battery is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\Delta V = V_f - V_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of the quantities we will define using the $\\Delta$ symbol is **displacement**. This is a vector quantity giving the distance between the starting (${\\vec r}_i$) and ending (${\\vec r}_f$) points, i.e. \"as the crow files\". Thus, it is an easy quantity to work with -- if an object moves through some path, to find the displacement, it does not matter what the path is, just the beginning and end of it. Obviously, objects can move through some very convoluted paths due to forces acting on them, so why is the particular trajectory not important? I can give you two answers for this, depending on the situation. For some, such as a basketball thrown out onto the court, the effect of gravity will result in only *one* possible path from your hands to where the ball lands; if I know the displacement of the ball, I can calculate everything else about the motion (such as time of flight, initial velocity). For other situations, this may not be clear. However, I can think of the complicated path as a big number of small displacements put together, one after the other. This is where using a computer is great -- I can tell the computer what the rules are for each displacement, and it will find the trajectory of the object. An example of this is if I threw a feather out on the court instead. If I tell the computer the rules for both gravity and air resistance, it can find the overall displacement as the sum of a bunch of individual pieces.\n",

    "First, note that the position is given by the symbol $r$; we will tend to use this, although you will often see distances along a particular axis given as $r_x$ or $r_y$, for example. Also, these are actually **vector** quantities; we know this because of the \"arrow\" sign above each of the symbols. For now, we are not going to worry too much about the idea of a vector -- we will explore these more in Lesson 04 (introduction to vectors). However, it will be important here to know that vectors have *direction*. Hopefully, you can already see this when you plug numbers into the equation above. If $r_{i, y} = 3$ and $r_{f, y} = 5$, then $\\Delta r_y = 2$, while if the initial and final numbers are reversed, then $\\Delta r_y = -2$. When the displacement $\\Delta r_y$ is *positive*, the object has moved in the positive direction, while the negative displacement means the motion was in the negative direction.

    "Let's set up what we are trying to do. We are going to give the computer information about the initial position and velocity of a sphere, i.e. the values at $t = 0$, and then tell it to calculate the position at later times. For now, we are assuming only constant speed motion in the $x$ direction, so we only want to calculate the position $r_x$. Since the computer cannot do an infinite number of calculations, we will give it a fixed time step value $\\Delta t$, and ask it to find the position $r_{1, x}$ at $t = \\Delta t$, then the position $r_{2, x}$ at $t = 2 \\Delta t$, and so on. Since we are only computing the position at integer numbers of time steps, we will label all of our quantities by the number of time steps that have passed, not the actual time. To find the time, you would then multiply the number of time steps by the size of the time step.\n",

During *each* time step -- going from $t = n \\Delta t$ to $t = (n + 1) \\Delta t$, the ball has gone from an initial position $r_{n, x}$ to a final position $r_{n + 1, x}$. Since we are assuming that the velocity is constant, and in the $x$ direction, there will be a fixed velocity $v_x$. Technically, it doesn't matter if we use the velocity at $t = n \\Delta t$, or $t = (n + 1) \\Delta t$, or even $t = 0$! However, it will matter much more later in the course, so we are going to be a little careful about how we do this. Let's assume that we use the velocity at the beginning of each time step, i.e. $v_{n, x}$. This will be our average velocity, since the velocity is constant, meaning we can just use our equation from above in the $x$ direction:\n",

Notice that we start with a position $r_{n, x}$ and add a change $\\Delta r_{n, x}$ to it, so we know what the position is at the next time step.

A `while` loop instructs the computer to keep executing a series of commands over and over again, until we tell it to stop. The program will exit the `while` loop when a logical test is satisfied.\n",

    "In the cell above, insert the line `while t < MAX_TIME:` just *before* the last statement (the position update statement). Also, remember that the computer knows which statements are inside the `while` because they are indented, so indent the code `ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity * dt` by using the Tab key. Finally, we need time to move forward inside the `while` loop (or it will never stop!) so add the statement `t = t + DT`.\n",

    "When the program reaches the `while` statement, the computer will check to see if the statement `t < MAX_TIME` is true. Remember that we have defined `MAX_TIME` to be 3 for this program. Since it is, it will run the two lines of code within the `while` loop in order, and then check again to see if `t < MAX_TIME` is true. The `while` loop will thus repeat, over and over, until `t` is greater than or equal to `MAX_TIME`. Since we are adding `DT` to `t` everytime the loop is repeated, eventually `t < MAX_TIME` will no longer be true. Once this happens, the program will move to the next thing after all of the statements in the `while` loop (which here is the end of the program, so the computer stops).\n",

Then they run the program, and it looks like the computer has frozen! Instead, the computer is running exactly what you told it to, to change the position `ball.pos` but *not* the time. So the `while` loop never stops, since the condition `t < MAX_TIME` is always satisfied. Don't forget this part!\n",

    "Because computers are very fast, the ball moved so fast that you saw only a flash! To slow down the animation, insert the statement `rate(100)` inside the loop, just after the `while` statement, indented as usual. This specifies that the `while` loop will not be executed more than 100 times per second, even if your computer is capable of many more than 100 loops per second. The way it works is that each time around the loop VPython checks to see whether 1/100th of a second has elapsed since the previous iteration. If not, VPython waits until that much time has gone by. This ensures that there are no more than 100 iterations performed in one second.\n",

    "This lesson has three major pieces. The first dealt with the SI system of units, and dealt with building up derived units with prefixes, and converting between two different units. Along the way, we also talked about scientific notation and significant digits. We will be using all of these concepts throughout the year, so you need to maintain a solid grasp of using them. Remember to periodically review this material when it gets fuzzy. The second part covered displacement, as well as average and instantaneous velocity. These concepts were defined, and various relationships between them laid out. This includes how to get displacement from a velocity vs. time graph, and velocity from a position vs. time graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final part covered the vPython package, using it to create a `sphere` object. We talked about the attributes of objects like this, and how they can be defined. Then, from the definition of average velocity, the Euler method enabled us to animate the sphere, so it moved at a constant velocity. This included the use of a `while` loop for updating the position of the sphere. Finally, the position and velocity components of the sphere were graphed using the `graph` and `gcurve` modules in vPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert between different types of units, including SI and non-SI units, as well as units with prefixes.\n",
    "* Write a number in proper scientific notation, with the correct number of signficant figures.\n",

    "* Describe the Euler method.\n",

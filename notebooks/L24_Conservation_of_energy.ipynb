    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we found the work done by any generic force, as the system it acts on undergoes a displacement. This force could be constant (such as the force of gravity near the surface of the Earth) or changing (like the spring force). However, this is not the best way to divide forces, at least when talking about work. Instead, we will see that it is best to focus on those forces where the work done by the force leads to a scalar uniquely defined at every state of the system. This scalar will be known as a \"potential energy\" of the force, and the force will be known as a \"conservative force\". The reason to do this is that if we can associate a specific scalar -- the \"mechanical energy\" of the system -- based on both kinetic and potential energies, then a constant mechanical energy allows us to predict the evolution of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our gameplan for this lesson is the following. First, we discuss which forces we can define potential energies for. There are a limited number of such forces, but they will be very helpful to use. This means we need to specify the difference between a conservative force and a non-conservative force; a potential energy can only be defined for a conservative force. Then we can add up the kinetic energy and all the potential energies of the system to get the system's mechanical energy. If only conservative forces act on the system, then the mechanical energy is conserved, according to the work-energy theorem of the last lesson. However, if we have non-conservative forces as well, we need to take these into account. That will be the final portion of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the objectives for this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define potential energy, and describe its relation to the force done by a conservative force.\n",
    "* Define mechanical energy, and explain when mechanical energy is conserved for a system.\n",
    "* Use the conservation of energy equation to solve for an unknown quantity in a system.\n",
    "* Describe the relationship between mechanical energy and the work done by non-conservative forces.\n",
    "* Use the conservation of energy equation to solve for an unknown quantity in a system, when non-conservative forces are present."

    "As outlined in the last section, our first step is to see where we can define a potential energy. Before we do that, let's motivate why we can do that in the first place! For some forces, the work done by that force can be \"stored\" in the system. To see what that means, imagine that you have a person skating on a frictionless surface. You can see this by running the cell below, selecting \"Intro\", and then moving the person onto the ramp and letting go. The skater will then move along the ramp."

    "If you watch the motion of the skater, you will see that they will continue moving forever. When they start at the top of the ramp, the gravitational force will pull them along the ramp, and they will speed up until they reach the bottom. At that point, as they start moving up the opposite side, gravity will slow them down, until they reach the same height again. But there is no friction, so this process will repeat itself over and over! There is some physical quantity related to gravity that is lost when the skater moves down the ramp, but is gained back in full when going back up the other side.\n",

    "Let's make this idea more general by considering some unknown force ${\\vec F}$ acting on an object. Suppose you take the object and you move it from point $a$ to point $b$ in the figure below, using the long path with the green arrow. You find that the unknown force does 60 J of work on the object. Then you use the shorter path (the red arrow) to move the object back from point $b$ to point $a$. In this case, the force does -60 J of work.\n",

Said a different way, there is *no change* in the energy of the object when it takes a full cycle around the two arrows. This means for this force, there is some quantity that remains the same, regardless of how you go along the path. If we go against the arrows, then the signs of the works flip, but we still get the same net work of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This force is known as a conservative force. A **conservative** force is one where the work done by the force on an object does not depend on the path taken by the object, for given initial and final points -- all the energy put into the system can be gotten back out at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is not true of all forces! Imagine that the force of friction were acting on the object as it followed the two arrows (you can think of this as moving on the surface of a table). Since the force of friction has a constant magnitude, the work done by friction $W_{fr}$ is greater for a larger distance. In addition, the frictional force is always opposing the motion of the object, so the work $W_{fr}$ will be negative, regardless of which arrow you follow. Thus, the force of friction is *not* a conservative force -- you can't get back energy from friction! \n",

The block is at rest because the net force at this location is zero; if this was not true, the spring and block would start accelerating. Thus, we first need to use Newton's second law here. This will allow us to calculate the spring constant of the vertical spring, which we do not know at this point. The net force on the block is due to the upward force $F_{spr}$ on the block from the spring, as well as the downward force $F_g$ of gravity. Setting the magnitudes of these two forces equal to each other,\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we can look at what happens when the block is pushed down further. The net force will *not* be zero here, since the spring force is larger than the block's weight. This is why the block will accelerate upward until it is pushed completely off the spring. Since the spring force depends on the distance the spring is away from its equilibrium, we cannot use the kinematic equations -- the acceleration changes with time, so it is not constant! This is why using the conservation of mechanical energy is the best choice: we only need to know what is happening between the initial state (when the block is pushed down to its lowest point) and the final state (the block has left the spring, so the spring is no longer compressed).\n",

    "If we take the initial and final states outlined in the paragraph above, then the block is (momentarily) at rest at both of these points. This means $K_i = K_f = 0$. The spring is also not compressed in the final state, since the block is no longer sitting on it, giving $U_{s, f} = 0$. The block is compressing the spring at the beginning, however, so $U_{s, i} \\neq 0$ from the total compression $r$ of $2.64 + 5.36 = 8.00$ cm from the equilibrium. Last, we turn to the gravitational potential energy. Here we need to make a choice about where to put the reference height. This is different than the choice for the spring potential energy, which was already chosen (when $U_s$ was defined) to be the spring's equilibrium position. Since there is no strong reason to choose one height over another, let's pick the block's final position as the height where $U_g = 0$. This gives $U_{g, f} = 0$ and $U_{g, i} = mgh$, where $h < 0$ is the distance from the starting and ending heights of the block -- negative since the initial position is below the final. Thus, our final energy conservation equation is\n",

Plugging in the numbers, and taking the absolute value, we have $|h| = 12.12$ cm. However, this is the total distance from the initial to the final heights, and we want only the height above the spring's equilibrium point.

    "Energy methods are one of the most powerful techniques in physics. Notice that it is all in one equation! That is one of the advantages of using conservation of energy. In fact, if you decide to pursue physics as a major, you will see that many of the more advanced methods you will see are just different versions of writing down the mechanical energy of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flip slide, though, is that all the energies are scalars, so information about direction is lost. For example, you can use mechanical energy to find the speed of an object at a given position, but not its velocity, since you cannot determine the drection using a scalar. However, with that being said, you can learn a lot from using the conservation of mechanical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define mechanical energy.\n",
    "* State the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.\n",
    "* Use the change in mechanical energy equation to solve for an unknown quantity such as the speed or position of an object at a particular time."

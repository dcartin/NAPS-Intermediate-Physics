    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind this is based on Newton's 1st and 2nd laws of motion. The first law says that an object will move with a constant velocity unless acted on by an outside force. In terms of linear momentum, this says that the object (or system of objects) will have a constant ${\\vec p}$ unless external forces are present. Newton's second law then relates the net external force to the change in the system's linear momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar manner, angular momentum ${\\vec L}$ is a measure of the rotational motion of an object about a chosen axis. This is given by\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    {\\vec L} = I {\\vec \\omega}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use our \"road map\" between linear and angular quantities to see why this would be the appropriate form. Namely, we replace mass with moment of inertia, $m \\to I$, and we change linear velocity into angular velocity, so ${\\vec v} \\to {\\vec \\omega}$. There is no special name for the units of angular momentum; thus, ${\\vec L}$ has SI units of kg m$^2$/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It turns out this is actually not the *general* definition of angular momentum, but it is good enough for our purposes. There are \"natural\" rotation axes for an object, and this equation for angular momentum assumes that the actual rotation is around such a (fixed) axis. However, this may not be true if an object is \"wobbling\" -- that is, when its angular velocity and angular momentum vectors do not point in the same direction. The Earth is an example of this, since there is a slight change in the direction of its rotation axis, known as the [Chandler wobble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_wobble) after its discoverer. If you go into engineering, you may see situations where these factors are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like Newton's 2nd law says changes in linear momentum are due to net forces, there is a corresponding rotational version of this equation. Here, it says that changes in *angular* momentum are due to a net *torque* acting on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\sum {\\vec \\tau} = \\frac{\\Delta {\\vec L}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this can be seen by our analogy between linear and rotational quantities. Here, we replace force with torque, ${\\vec F} \\to {\\vec \\tau}$, and linear momentum with angular momentum, or ${\\vec p} \\to {\\vec L}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The attentive reader may notice that I have tried to pull a fast one on you! Before, I said that conservation of linear momentum in the absence of net external forces is a re-statement of the principle of inertia (Newton's 1st law). However, inertia only deals with constant *velocity*. As we saw when we discussed uniform circular motion, there is no corresponding \"rotational\" version of Newton's 1st law -- in other words, objects do not have a natural tendency to rotate, since this requires a centripetal force acting on the object. However, it turns out that the answer to this riddle deals with the *symmetry* of physics. One (slightly strange) way to say this is that if I took the entire Universe and rotated it, the laws of physics would be exactly the same -- no one would notice! Modern physics is now based heavily on this idea of symmetry, based on the ideas of [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether), as discussed in the following videos."

To explore this situation, keep `INIT_RADIUS = 4`, but change `INIT_VELOCITY` to `vector(-1, 2, 0)`. Calculate the magnitude of the angular momentum for this case. The maximum and minimum radii are about 5.1 and 3.1, respectively. Use these values to find the speeds at these points, and compare to the speed vs. time graph."

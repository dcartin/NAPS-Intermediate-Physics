    "# Biot-Savart law\n",
    "\n",
    "What we now call \"electricity\" and \"magnetism\" have been familiar to many for over two thousand years. However, for much of that time, they were interesting effects, and not much else; there was no theory behind the existence of electric and magnetic properties. In fact, although some had suspected a relationship between them, nothing definite was known. This began to change in the 18th and 19th centuries, as technology advanced to the point where they could be studied. In particular, with the development of the electric battery by Volta in 1800, a continuous electric current was possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bridge between electricity and magnetism was first built by the efforts of the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Oersted, who did the necessary experiments around 1820. In these, he showed that a constant electric current through a wire produced a magnetic field. Again, it is useful to take a moment and think how important this result was. Although electric and magnetic fields have some similarities (as discussed in Lesson 34), this does not necessarily mean they are one and the same phenomenon. However, it was the results of Oersted, and many others in the next few years, who conclusively showed that we should not think of \"electricity\" and \"magnetism\" separately, but instead to put it into \"electromagnetism\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we will not get into this further in this course, the unification of electricity and magnetism was an important event in the history of physics. Over the next 175 years or so, the main course of theoretical physics was a similar path of unification, using many mathematical ideas first developed for electromagnetism. The fruits of this are in what is known as the Standard Model of particle physics, joining electromagnetism together with the strong nuclear force (keeping nuclei together) and the weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactive decay). The Standard Model uses the idea of fields as a basic component, and represents our best current knowledge of how fundamental physics works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will answer a basic question: where do magnetic fields come from? Shortly after Oersted published his experiments, a key part of the answer was found by two physicists, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Felix Savart, building off the idea of the motion of electric charge in a current giving a magnetic field. We will explore their results in this lesson.\n",

    "## The long, straight wire\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we state the Biot-Savart law, let's first talk about what Oersted found in his experiments. Suppose we have a long, straight wire; basically, we are considering a straight wire whose length is much greater than its radius (or thickness). After some confusion about what was happening, Oersted finally realized that the magnetic field around the wire is circular. In other words, we would say that the magnetic field lines are circles, with their center at the wire itself. You can see this in the video given below ([source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3A17._%D0%95%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82.ogv)). When there is no current through the wire, the compass points in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. However, when the voltage source is turned on, and current flows through the wire, the compass shifts to point in the direction of the much stronger magnetic field of the wire."

Imagine that you are grabbing the wire with your right hand. When you point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the wire's current, your fingers will naturally curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines. For example, if you see the current moving upward, then with your right thumb pointing upward as well, your fingers will go right to left *behind* the wire, and left to right *in front of* the wire. We will see later in this lesson how to relate this to the right-hand rule we saw in Lesson 34 for the magnetic force.\n",

    "As we saw, Oersted found that the magnetic field lines around a long, straight wire are circles centered on the wire. So how can we extend this to more complicated wires? We will follow a similar path to what we have done with previous fields: build up the complicated cases as a sum of a lot of simple cases. In particular, imagine that we have a small bit of wire; this is represented by the vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$, where $\\Delta \\ell$ is a small length. Following through this wire is a current $I$. The direction of the vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ gives the direction of the (conventional) current.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine that we want to find the magnetic field vector at a point $P$. To do this, we need the position vector of $P$ relative to the wire. This is given by ${\\vec r}$ -- this vector *starts* at the center of the wire $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$, and points *towards* the point $P$. To see this set-up, run the program below. The green cylinder is the wire, with the current shown by the white arrow inside of it. The position vector ${\\vec r}$ is the yellow arrow from the wire to the point $P$ to the left of the screen."

In the program above, the vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ along the wire points in the $+y$ direction. The position vector ${\\vec r}$, from the wire to the point $P$, is in the $-x$ direction, which means that the unit vector ${\\hat r}$ points in the same direction. So, using the right-hand rule with the vector product $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell} \\times {\\hat r}$ give that it points in the $+z$ axis. Notice that this is exactly what I said earlier with the \"right-hand rule\" using currents and the circular magnetic fields! Point your thumb in the direction of the current ($+y$), and your fingers will naturally point towards you on the left side of the wire."

    "## Magnetic field at center of a circular wire\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now go through our first example of using the Biot-Savart law: finding the magnetic field at the center of a circular wire with a current through it. You might be surprised that we are not finding the field at some point near a long, straight wire, but it turns out the circular loop of wire is actually an easier place to start! The physical situation is shown in the figure below, where the loop has a radius $R$ and a current $I$ flowing through it. We want to find the total magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ at the point $P$, at the center of the circular wire. To do this, we can pretend that the circle is a regular polygon with a large number of sides $N$, and add up the contributions from the current flowing through each of these sides. Then, making $N$ larger and larger will get us closer to the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each side of our polygon, the length vector ${\\vec L}$ is perpendicular to the radius vector ${\\vec r}$.

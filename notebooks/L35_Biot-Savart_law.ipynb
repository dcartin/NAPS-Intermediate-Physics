    "# Biot-Savart law\n",
    "\n",
    "What we now call \"electricity\" and \"magnetism\" have been familiar to many for over two thousand years. However, for much of that time, they were interesting effects, and not much else; there was no theory behind the existence of electric and magnetic properties. In fact, although some had suspected a relationship between them, nothing definite was known. This began to change in the 18th and 19th centuries, as technology advanced to the point where they could be studied. In particular, with the development of the electric battery by Volta in 1800, a continuous electric current was possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bridge between electricity and magnetism was first built by the efforts of the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Oersted, who did the necessary experiments around 1820. In these, he showed that a constant electric current through a wire produced a magnetic field. Again, it is useful to take a moment and think how important this result was. Although electric and magnetic fields have some similarities (as discussed in Lesson 34), this does not necessarily mean they are one and the same phenomenon. However, it was the results of Oersted, and many others in the next few years, who conclusively showed that we should not think of \"electricity\" and \"magnetism\" separately, but instead to put it into \"electromagnetism\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we will not get into this further in this course, the unification of electricity and magnetism was an important event in the history of physics. Over the next 175 years or so, the main course of theoretical physics was a similar path of unification, using many mathematical ideas first developed for electromagnetism. The fruits of this are in what is known as the Standard Model of particle physics, joining electromagnetism together with the strong nuclear force (keeping nuclei together) and the weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactive decay). The Standard Model uses the idea of fields as a basic component, and represents our best current knowledge of how fundamental physics works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will answer a basic question: where do magnetic fields come from? Shortly after Oersted published his experiments, a key part of the answer was found by two physicists, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Felix Savart, building off the idea of the motion of electric charge in a current giving a magnetic field. We will explore their results in this lesson.\n",

    "## Long, straight wires\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we state the Biot-Savart law, let's first talk about what Oersted found in his experiments. Suppose we have a long, straight wire; basically, we are considering a straight wire whose length is much greater than its radius (or thickness). Oersted sent a current through such a wire, and saw that a nearby compass changed its direction every time he did this. When he turned off the current, the compass returned to its original orientation. Oersted grasped that this was because the current in the wire was creating a magnetic field of its own! After some confusion about the direction of this field, Oersted finally realized that the magnetic field around the wire is circular. In other words, we would say that the magnetic field lines are circles, with their center at the wire itself. You can see a reproduction of Oersted's experiment in the video given below ([source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3A17._%D0%95%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82.ogv)). When there is no current through the wire, the compass points in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. However, when the voltage source is turned on, and current flows through the wire, the compass shifts to point in the direction of the much stronger magnetic field of the wire."

    "\n",
    "Let's now go through our first example of using the Biot-Savart law: finding the magnetic field at the center of a circular wire with a current through it. You might be surprised that we are not finding the field at some point near a long, straight wire, but it turns out the circular loop of wire is actually an easier place to start! Imagine we have a circular loop with a radius $R$ and a current $I$ flowing through it. We want to find the total magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ at the point $P$, at the center of the circular wire. To do this, we can pretend that the circle is a regular polygon with a large number of sides $N$, and add up the contributions from the current flowing through each of these sides. Then, making $N$ larger and larger will get us closer to the final answer.\n",

    "The picture below shows the basic set-up for approximating the circle by a polygon. The green sides represent the polygon (here with twelve sides), while the dotted line is the circle the polygon is used to estimate. For each side of our polygon, the length vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ is perpendicular to the radius vector ${\\vec r}$. Thus, if ${\\vec r} = (R \\cos \\theta) {\\hat x} + (R \\sin \\theta) {\\hat y}$, then $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell} = [-(\\Delta \\ell) \\sin \\theta] {\\hat x} + [(\\Delta \\ell) \\cos \\theta] {\\hat y}$.

Then, each side has a vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ starting at the point $P_k$, and ending at the next counterclockwise point $P_{k + 1}$. How do we find these points? Since we are dividing the circle into $N$ parts, each point $P_k$ is an angle $2\\pi k/N$ along the circle from the $+x$ axis.

    "\n",
    "In the last example, we found the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop, by dividing the loop into small pieces $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$, and then adding up the magnetic field contributions $\\Delta {\\vec B}$ from each of these pieces. Now we'll turn to the magnetic field created by a long, straight wire, and how this would be done in vPython. Here, \"long\" just means that the total length of the wire is large compared to the radius of the circular wire itself. We will eventually see what happens in the limit where the length gets really large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the wire as a length $L$, and is placed along the $x$ axis, with the current in the $+x$ direction. The wire is centered at $r_x = 0$, and we will find the magnetic field ${\\vec B}$ at a position $(0, R, 0)$. To find this total magnetic field, we use the same process we did above with the circle: divide the wire into $N$ segments, and find the contributions $\\Delta {\\vec B}$ from each piece. These are added up to get the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to find the length vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ for each of these segments; I will do this in a little bit of detail, to help with a later step. We can find this vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ as the vector difference between the left and right sides of each segment. Starting with the index $k = 0$, the left side of the kth segment is at $r_x = -(L/2) + (kL/N)$. The first term comes from the fact that a wire centered at the origin will have its extreme left side at $r_x = -L/2$; then we count over $k$ segment lengths from the left to get to segment $k$. The right-hand side will be one segment length larger in $r_x$, so it is at $r_x = -(L/2) + [(k + 1)L/N]$. The vector $\\Delta {\\vec \\ell}$ then points *from* the left side to the right. This is shown below, when the wire is divided into six segments.\n",

I will use the center of each piece as the \"location\" of the piece, and find its position relative to the observation point $P$, where we want to calculate the field. Based on what we just talked about, this location is at the point $r_x = -(L/2) + [(k + 1/2)L/N]$, since the middle of the segment is halfway along the segment length of $L/N$. Thus, the position vector ${\\vec r}_k$ pointing *from* the center of segment $k$, *to* the point $P$ where we want to find the field, is given by\n",

When $N$ is odd, one of the segments has its center at $r_x = 0$, directly below the point $P$. Since this is relatively close to the point, it has an exaggerated effect, making $B_z$ too large. The opposite happens when $N$ is even. For those $N$, the centers of the wire segments are further away, reducing $B_z$. However, these two effects eventually get smaller as $N$ gets larger; the computed value of $B_z$ is essentially the same as the theoretical value for $N = 30$.

Unlike the electric field (where the sources were just charges), the resulting magnetic fields are more complicated.

Hopefully you are getting some good practice with the vector product!\n",

This relationship was shown to work both ways, which is why we now think of \"electromagnetism\", rather than \"electricity\" and \"magnetism\" separately. This deep marriage of the two will continue in the next lesson, where we turn to Faraday's law. This law relates the change of electric fields in *space* to produce changes in magnetic fields in *time*. It is because of such relations that we have light waves!\n",

Taking the limit $\\Delta t \\to 0$ gives the instantaneous velocity and acceleration; in graph terms, this would be the slope at a particular time on a position vs. time or velocity vs. time graph, respectively. Up until now, we have focused more on understanding what velocity and acceleration mean, and how to code them into a computer simulation. Our next step is to view these quantities from a more mathematical side. Building from the basic definitions, we will see that there are equations that relate them to each other. Specifically, we will assume *constant acceleration*, and see where that takes us.\n",
